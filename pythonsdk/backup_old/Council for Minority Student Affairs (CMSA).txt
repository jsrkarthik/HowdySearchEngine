Jose Luis Zelaya represents the finest of our generation, putting himself through college by crocheting beanies and private scholarships. An undocumented student confronted with legal barriers to pursuing his dream of teaching, he\u2019s chosen to dedicate his life to service of others through service at Texas A&M University.\n\nThe vote against Zelaya\u2019s confirmation was based solely on his lack of status, student senators went as far as dehumanizing him by calling him as an \u201cillegal alien\u201d. This reflects the sharply political atmosphere in Senate, the influence of extreme conservatism and lack of information has on the representative body of students at Texas A&M. \u201cWhen student senators openly state that you\u2019re the most qualified to serve our University but shouldn\u2019t because you lack an immigration status, we have a problem. Jose Luis loves Aggieland. Jose Luis bleeds maroon. Let Jose Luis serve!\u201d said, Jacob Cobb, Senior Biomedical Science major, Class of 2013.\n\nAccording to the Council for Minority Student Affairs the message that the student senate is sending with this vote is, \u201cAggieland: where you can love your country and your school but you can\u2019t serve either one.\u201d\n\n###", "type": "status", "id": "178774148815574_437061232986863", "status_type": "mobile_status_update", "likes": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTE3OTY0OTQ4OQ==", "before": "MTAwMDAwODIwMzE2ODg2"}}, "data": [{"id": "100000820316886", "name": "Felicia Charles"}, {"id": "1522080607", "name": "Nicole A\u00f1onuevo"}, {"id": "1134505297", "name": "Gabriela Zelaya"}, {"id": "757063676", "name": "Cassy Diamond"}, {"id": "8313385", "name": "Aurora Alvarado"}, {"id": "1407861705", "name": "Carlos Hernandez"}, {"id": "1343174085", "name": "Rickey Cavazos"}, {"id": "202603348", "name": "Luis Maldonado"}, {"id": "100000216480996", "name": "Eduardo Ramirez Avi\u00f1a"}, {"id": "1179649489", "name": "Shawncy Karina"}]}}

Community members and students criticized the event as immature and propagating the image of a university that isn't welcoming to minorities\n\n\u201cWhile we acknowledging that the protest is protected speech, the Aggie Conservatives' planned demonstration will propagate the image of an intolerant campus. Texas A&M graduates carry not only a tradition of excellence, but also a stigma of closed-mindedness that are only reinforced by the actions of TAC.
