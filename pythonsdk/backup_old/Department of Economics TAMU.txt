Under the new leadership of NES Rector Simeon Djankov, our university plans to take this opportunity to launch a program that is expected to stand amongst the top-five graduate energy programs in the world over the next five years. Prospective students will have two options to choose from: a two-year Master's degree program, or a four-month professional development program.\n\nIn a recent interview, NES Vice Rector Zarema Kasabieva explained the rationale for such optimistic hopes for this new program and discussed in more detail what it will look like:\n\"First of all, NES is already well-known for its high quality of education and research. And NES has more than 30 young professors on its faculty who received their PhDs from the world's top universities and chose to return to Russia to teach. Of those, 40% have research interests in and publications on natural resource and energy economics. Out of our 1400 graduates, more than 100 work in the energy industry at companies and organizations that deal with the extraction and processing of natural resources.\u201d\n\u201cIn developing our curriculum, NES is going to consider analyses of the top energy and natural resource economics MA and MBA programs. It will include the same courses that are currently offered for our Master's in Economics degree, including core economics and elective courses and applied courses in the field of economics. This new program will also include a series of seminars and guest lectures on the latest trends and developments in the field. Students will have access to internships at companies in the energy and natural resources industries, and they will undertake projects at NES's partner institutions that companies in this field will help to coordinate. Taken together, all of these elements will make our program highly competitive both in Russia and beyond.\u201d \n\nThose interested in receiving further updates about this program as it develops may contact me at rjohnston@nes.ru to be placed on our mailing list.", "type": "status", "id": "311138628945759_605828176143468", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}

This course can significantly increase your GRE scores.\n\nIt's about half the price of other GRE Prep courses, and discounts are available for those who sign up early. National test prep companies charge $1200 or more for the same content you'll get in one weekend. In addition, their courses may be taught by someone with less than three-months training.\n\nThis GRE prep course is taught by Hudson Cody Blair, Class of '91, who is a National Merit Scholar and has been teaching study skills, SAT prep, and GRE prep for over 12 years. Mr. Blair often contracts with different offices here at TAMU to provide GRE Prep and Study Skills, and he's the author of the popular and award winning Wired Study Tips podcasts on iTunesU, hosted by the TAMU College of Engineering.\n\nMr. Blair covers everything students need to maximize verbal, quantitative, and analytical writing scores on the GRE. Students also learn what to practice and how to practice in the days, weeks, or months, before taking the GRE.\n\nNEXT CLASS Saturday and Sunday, Nov. 16/17, from 8 AM to 5 PM each day, with a one hour lunch break.
