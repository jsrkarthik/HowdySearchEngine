This event will feature a panel of experts who will discuss the ongoing crisis in Syria.\n\nThe war began in March 2011 with the streets of Damascus filling up with people protesting against the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Asad, and to this day, the rebel opposition and the loyalist forces are engaged in a fight that threatens the lives of millions of Syrians and exacerbates the humanitarian crisis in the country. In the two years since the fighting began, the UN estimates that more than 100,000 Syrians have been killed, mostly rebel fighters and civilians. As a result of the fighting, over 4.5 million Syrians have been displaced internally, and over 2.2 million Syrians have become international refugees. One of the largest refugee camps, the Zaatari refugee camp, is located across the border in Jordan and home to over 150,000 Syrian refugees.\n\nThe United States has put into a place a full-scale embargo against Syria, but has taken military action off the table despite President Obama's assertion that the use of chemical weapons may draw such a response. As a result of Russia's continued support of Syria, relations between the United States and Russia have become markedly tenser. The United States and the rest of international community have shifted their focus to what they can do to help the Syrian people and bring this bloody conflict to a peaceful and fair end while ensuring Syrian stability moving forward. Although the use of chemical weapons against civilians did not prompt an immediate US military response to the crisis, the US did agree to seize and destroy Syrian chemical weapons under international oversight. Will the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles satisfy the West and overcast the larger proportion of conventional brutality? How will the US respond to the humanitarian crisis in the coming months? How will this crisis affect US-Russia relations?\n\nTo see the Facebook page for this event, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/mscwiley.

Genomics and Society  \n\nM/W 4.10-5.25 in YMCA 109\n\nCourse Description: This course provides an introduction to, and an exploration of, controversial issues relating to genomics in society. It considers social, ethical and policy questions raised by genomics in the context of: synthetic biology and biofuels, crops, genetic modification of domestic animals, the use of genetics in wildlife conservation, human genetic therapies, human enhancement, and privacy questions raised by the disclosure of genetic information.  The course will include a number of invited expert speakers in different areas of genomics, ethics, and society, from a variety of colleges across Texas A&M, and from outside the university. It will also include discussion of a number of topical and contested cases in genomics. Genomics and Society has been funded for development by a grant from the National Science Foundation, and will eventually exist as an online, as well as a \"live\" or \"hybrid\" course on campus. Consequently some speaker sessions in Spring 2014 will be filmed, and we will be using online discussion tools in the course.  \n\nStudents are not required to have a background in genomics or in philosophy.  The course should be accessible to students from backgrounds across the sciences, social sciences and humanities. For more information contact Clare Palmer at c.palmer@tamu.edu\n\nThis course can fulfill 3 hours of humanities credit and 3 hours of residency for sociology majors.", "type": "status", "id": "141996652530399_631176893612370", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}
