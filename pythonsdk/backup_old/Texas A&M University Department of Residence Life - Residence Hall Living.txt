Bowen Loftin\n\nSUBJECT:    Continued Energy Conservation by the Aggie Community\n\nIn recent years Texas A&M University has compiled an outstanding record of energy and water conservation. One of the keys to successful conservation is eliminating energy and water waste. Together, we have achieved some great results, but there is more that we can do to better steward our resources and operate more efficiently \u2013 saving money and helping the environment. I ask for the involvement of all students, faculty and staff to conserve energy and water and eliminate waste wherever possible. Please turn off all unneeded lights and equipment, and, if you notice wasteful use of energy that you cannot correct by yourself, please report it through our on-line \u201cAggieWorks\u201d work request system, which can be accessed at http://aggieworks.tamu.edu or 979-458-5500, so the necessary adjustments can be made.\n\nWith the heat of the summer still upon us and autumn just around the corner, please help us make sure building space temperatures are maintained as close as possible to the University temperature standard. Maintaining building temperatures within 2 degrees of the University standard of 75 F for cooling and 70 F for heating, during occupied hours, helps eliminate energy waste. If the temperature in your area is not properly regulated for any reason, please contact AggieWorks so that the necessary adjustments can be made. Please do not use space heaters unless you have reported a problem and there is a reason your space temperature cannot be adjusted to maintain the proper range.\n\nAt the same time consider your own use of water and strive to minimize how much water you use routinely.  We also ask that you report (via AggieWorks) any water leaks or wasteful use of water you observe on campus.\n\nYou can make a positive difference by taking the lead for conservation in your work or living areas, educating others about the need to maintain proper space temperature, and turning off unnecessary lights and equipment. In laboratories, please make sure fume hood sashes are closed and other equipment is properly secured when not in use, improving both safety and conservation.\n\nContact AggieWorks (see link and phone number above) to report items such as:\n\n1.\tBuilding space temperatures that are too hot or cold\n2.\tLeaks or other wasteful use of energy or water  \n3.\tOpportunities where A/C can be set back or shut off after regular hours \n4.\tRequest assistance shutting off lighting and equipment when not in use\n\nThank you for your ongoing support for energy conservation and campus sustainability.", "type": "link", "id": "46382914338_489189987760303", "status_type": "shared_story", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif"}
