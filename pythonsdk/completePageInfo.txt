The organization began with only two house teams and Sunday practices and has grown to have four house teams and weekly practices for those committed to playing on the intercollegiate level. \n\nWe have two levels of play offered to members: intramural and intercollegiate. Intramural play refers to the sunday house matches which are generally relaxed and less competitive. Intercollegiate play requires extra weekly practices which are currently set up on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. These practices are designed to improve players' skills, agility, strength, and endurance, so they can compete in competitive matches against other colleges and represent the organization on a national front. \n\nThe organization also holds social events (i.e. House lunches, Team dinners, and Yule Ball) and participates in volunteer work (i.e. Big Event and Glow Run). \n\n**Practice Times**\nSunday- 3pm Simpson Drill Field\nMonday, Wednesday and Thursday- 6:30 Penberthy Lighted Fields\n\n\n**New Member Info**\nWe accept new members year round as long as they sign a waiver and pay dues.

Here students embark on a journey of self-discovery. They learn how to unlock their creative potential, become lifelong learners, intellectual leaders and knowledge creators.\n\nThe college is literally abuzz with creativity around the clock as its 1,900 students, 140 faculty and 59 professional staff engage in myriad design and multimedia projects focused on the transformation of the human environment. Space is in constant motion as students collaborate and concepts take form in sketches, paintings, computer simulations, models, photographs, sculptures and video.\n\nArchitectural installations and artwork are regularly erected, studied and deconstructed. The walls are papered with an ever-changing mosaic of project posters that are pinned up, rigorously reviewed, and taken down to make room for next review.\n\nWhile some students study alone in private nooks, computer labs or the college\u2019s reference library, others collaborate in studios, classrooms or the coffee shop. There are lectures, seminars, workshops, design charrettes, exhibits, concerts, film screenings, celebrations and special events \u2014 many planned and many impromptu.\n\nA cacophony of busy power tools and sophisticated machinery echoes from the college\u2019s woodshop where architectural models, furniture, artwork and special projects take shape. On the nearby prairie, the whirl and hum of a CNC router and plasma cutter denote more substantial structures in the works at the college\u2019s 12-acre Digital Fabrication Facility, referred to affectionately by students as the \u201cArchitecture Ranch.\u201d\n \nBecause the creativity and empathy with which each discipline is practiced has a profound influence on the quality of life in society, College of Architecture students are challenged to weave aesthetics, safety, function, financial feasibility, sustainability and environmental stewardship into the creative process.\n\nRecognizing that no single professional track or narrow specialization can adequately prepare tomorrow\u2019s building, design, planning and visualization professionals, the college is distinctive in offering a truly interdisciplinary curriculum. As one of the largest schools of its kind, housing all of the built environment disciplines, the college is uniquely suited to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research.\n\nIts rich and diverse research portfolio includes projects conducted in its four academic departments, through its multiple institutes, research centers and specialized laboratories, and in collaboration with other colleges and centers within the university and around the world. The college\u2019s Institute for Applied Creativity and five formally organized research centers \u2014 the CRS Center for Leadership and Management in the Design and Construction Industry, the Center for Housing and Urban Development, the Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center, the Center for Health Systems & Design, and the Center for Heritage Conservation \u2014 expand the public knowledge base of the industries and professions they serve while supporting specialized graduate certificate programs.\n\nAnd because we all live in a highly interconnected world, those pursuing an undergraduate degree at the college are required to spend a long semester away from Texas A&M University\u2019s College Station campus, either engaged in a professional internship or studying abroad in one of the college\u2019s well-established programs in Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom or elsewhere.", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1506904_10152253596825420_44185916_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10152253596825420", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50}, "name": "Texas A&M University College of Architecture", "website": "http://one.arch.tamu.edu/", "phone": "(979) 845-1222", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TAMU.architecture", "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "3137 TAMU", "zip": "77843-3137", "country": "United States"}, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "11950375419", "is_published": true}

By encouraging the physicians of tomorrow to work together today, the Texas A&M Pre-Medical Society does its part to build a spirit of cooperation, a spirit that is becoming ever more necessary in the medical profession.\n\n\nOur key goals are: to educate and advise students on undergraduate, medical school, and career options in the medical field. To serve the community through various projects done as an organization and individually. To work closely with the Office of Professional School Advising to prepare pre-medical students to be competitive applicants to medical school. To educate and inform members of the current state of medicine and, to provide a social forum to facilitate the interaction of pre-medical students.", "talking_about_count": 11, "cover": {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-g-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1.0-9/s720x720/543739_574473895918330_1109377097_n.jpg", "cover_id": "574473895918330", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 70}, "name": "Texas A&M Pre-Medical Society", "website": "aggiepremed.tamu.edu\ntwitter.com/aggiepremed", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/aggiepremed", "likes": 713, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "161941460504911", "is_published": true}

Created in 1950 in response to the needs of the Texas Highway Department, TTI has since broadened its focus to address all modes of transportation\u2014highway, air, water, rail and pipeline. TTI is a state agency and a member of The Texas A&M University System.\n\nTTI pioneered the \"breakaway\" and the \"crash cushion\" concepts.\nThe cooperative relationship with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), formalized by the Texas legislature in 1949, has been key to the success and real-world applicability of the TTI program. Knowledge and expertise gained through that program have helped TTI effectively develop and implement work for numerous other sponsors.\n\nTTI has a breadth and depth of programs, facilities, and capabilities unsurpassed by any university-affiliated transportation research program in the United States. TTI's urban research and implementation offices foster local agency cooperation and help ensure implementable research results. The institute also partners with other universities through regional divisions, which allows greater focus on region-specific transportation solutions. \n\n", "mission": "Our mission is to solve transportation problems through research, to transfer technology, and to develop diverse human resources to meet the transportation challenges of tomorrow.\n\n", "founded": "1949", "likes": 980, "parking": {"street": 0, "lot": 1, "valet": 0}, "id": "311158400744", "category": "University", "talking_about_count": 14, "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77843-3135", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.35284, "state": "TX", "street": "2929 Research Parkway", "latitude": 30.601246}, "username": "ttitamu", "hours": {"fri_1_close": "17:00", "thu_1_open": "08:00", "tue_1_close": "17:00", "mon_1_open": "08:00", "mon_1_close": "17:00", "wed_1_open": "08:00", "wed_1_close": "17:00", "tue_1_open": "08:00", "fri_1_open": "08:00", "thu_1_close": "17:00"}, "phone": "(979) 845-1713", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/ttitamu", "checkins": 70, "about": "Founded 1949 | Saving Lives, Time and Resources", "name": "Texas A&M Transportation Institute", "cover": {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-b-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1.0-9/s720x720/59628_10151920127120745_363734112_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10151920127120745", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0}, "products": "About TTI\n\nIt's why we go to work every day.\n-Saving lives \n-Solving problems \n-Building careers \n-Getting ahead of tomorrow's challenges, today \n\nThese simple statements give a glimpse of the uncluttered commitment and determination we hold at the Texas Transportation Institute.

In 1976, horticulture and floricultural activities were removed from the Soil and Crop Sciences Department and placed into a separate Department of Horticultural Sciences.Our mission has always been closely interwoven with that of the Morril Act, which provided for the creation of land-grant universities. Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862, the act established colleges that would teach military tactics as well as engineering and agriculture. The Hatch Act of 1887 established the Agricultural Experiment Station component, outreach function through the Cooperative Extension Service. Together the Morrill, Hatch, and Smith-Lever Acts formalized the three-part mission of all land-grant universities, education, research and extension.\n\nAgriculture produces food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, green space, and other products and benefits through the systematic production of plants and animals. Forty-two percent of the world\u2019s laborers are employed in agriculture. This makes it the most common occupation throughout the world.\n\nThe transofrmation of agriculture in many developing nations led to significant increases in agricultural production between the 1940s and the 1960s. Much of the increase in wheat production during what became known as the Green Revolution resulted from the introduction of better varieties developed by Dr. Norman Borlaug, a Distinguished Professor in our deparment who died in 2009. Called the Father of the Green Revolution, Dr. Borlaug was often credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increased food supply.\n\nChanging with the world\u2019s needs, the Soil and Crop Sciences Department has begun research and teaching in such areas as food science, water use and quality, bioenergy, turf ecology, and ecosystems, in addition to more standard agricultural areas.

Thanks to the support of crews around the state, donors, and the hard work of its members, the crew now posseses modern 8's so that they can race in.\n2011 is here and the team is growing more than ever.

", "talking_about_count": 4, "description": "The Texas A&M Stock Horse Team competes in American Stock Horse Association (ASHA) and the Stock Horse of Texas (SHOT) competitions.  They show in 4 events, including: Ranch Horse Trail, Reining, Working Cow Horse and Ranch Horse Pleasure.  The Texas A&M team consists of 8 members, with 6 competing at each show; 2 Novice, 2 Limited Non-Pro and 2 Non-Pro riders.\n\nTexas A&M is the only university with the  opportunity to use school horses.  This allows students to participate without owning their own horse.  However, students have the opportunity to use their own horse if it is better suited to the program and the students needs.\n\nThe stock horse team is a club team that is not affiliated with the NCAA womens equestrian team.  The stock horse team is a departmentally and privately funded organization, relying on students and fundraisers to fund horse show entries and participation.\n\n\nThe divisions are divided as follows:\n\n\u2022\tThe Open Division\nOpen to any professional or nonprofessional member, in good standing, with any horse regardless of past winnings. In addition to the normal entry fee, this division may collect and offer jackpot fees which will be paid back to winners according to the payout schedule in the SHOT Rule Book. These jackpot fees may range from a minimum of $10 to a maximum of $20 per class except for special events or championships.\n\n\u2022\t Non Pro Eligibility is as follows:\n1. Has not received payment, directly or indirectly for riding, training, assisting in training, showing horse(s) at any time during the past 5 years\n2. Has not received payment directly or indirectly for instructing another person or conducting a seminar in riding, training, driving or showing a horse any time during the past five years\n3. Has not had any expenses (including lodging, transportation, mileage, etc.) paid by someone else other than family members.\n\n\u2022\tLimited Non Pro Division Eligibility\nExhibitors who qualify as a Non Pro Rider may choose to show in this division because of class routine or other personal choice. Exhibitors may also show in the Open or Non-Pro divisions without losing their eligibility in the Limited Non Pro division. There will be no jackpot in this division. Riders in this division will work a modified version of the working cow horse class which will not involve turns down the fence, circling or roping (see LTD Non Pro and Junior Horse Working Cow Horse class rules for specifics on rules for this division.)\n\n\n\u2022\tNovice Division Eligibility and Restrictions\nThe Novice Division is reserved for individuals with limited riding and showing experience who wish to learn more about showing in SHOT at a beginner\u2019s pace. Everyone new to SHOT does not necessarily need to start in the Novice division. Their skills may be better suited for one of the other divisions. There will be no jackpot in this division.\nEligibility for the Novice division is as follows:\n1. Adheres to all non pro eligibility requirements listed above.\n2. Has not won any champion titles, reserve champion titles at any show or year-end in SHOT, ASHA, Texas State 4-H finals, or more than 5 points in any breed association (AQHA, APHA, etc.) or $100 in a national organization (NCHA, NRCHA, NRHA, RHAA, etc) in any western performance discipline (western pleasure, working cow horse, reining, cutting, trail, etc.)\n3. If a member loses their novice eligibility through competition, they may finish that year as a novice. In the future, the member is eligible only for Junior Horse, Youth, Limited Non-Pro, Non-Pro or Open Divisions.\n4. Riders in this division will work Novice and Youth Reining Patterns and a Novice and Youth Working Cow Horse Pattern. The cow horse pattern is a shortened version of cow work which will not involve turns down the fence, circling or roping.

{"category": "Musician/band", "bio": "The Texas A&M University-Commerce percussion program prides itself on preparing students to become outstanding professionals in their selected careers. The studio is currently comprised of 27 undergraduate majors and graduate students. Our small size combined with a well-rounded approach to percussion affords every student multiple performance opportunities and a great deal of one-on-one instruction.\n\nPerforming ensembles include:\n  Percussion Ensembles I & II\n    The Texas A&M-Commerce Percussion Ensemble has performed at state and international conventions including PASIC, TMEA and CBDNA.  We are one of the 2010 PAS International Percussion Ensemble Competition winners and also won this competition in 2000.  We have recorded two CD's: \u201cNew and Unknown Percussion Works of Minoru Miki\u201d, and \"Phage\".  This group performs a wide variety of pieces including standard percussion ensemble works, contemporary literature, keyboard ensembles, rags, classical transcriptions, jazz, and pop arrangements. \n\n  Panimation Steel Bands I & II\n    The PANIMATION steel drum band is part of the ensemble curriculum and performs throughout the semester on campus and around the North Texas area promoting the A&M-Commerce percussion studio.\n\n  Drumline\n    Since a majority of the undergraduate students are music education majors, the philosophy of the ensemble is to train students on every instrument while still maintaining a high level of performance. Therefore, over the course of their four years in the band, students can play the same instrument no more than two times. Additionally, if they marched in drum corps, they cannot play that same instrument during the marching season. This gives students an opportunity to learn how to play and teach every drumline instrument, resulting in highly prepared educators.\nCurrent and former students have marched or taught in the following drum corps: \nThe Cavaliers, Phantom Regiment, Bluecoats, The Cadets, Blue Knights, Carolina Crown, Crossmen, Spirit, Glassmen, Pioneer, and Revolution\n\n  Brazilian Ensemble\n    This ensemble provides a world drumming experience on our traditional Brazilian instruments.  Formed in the 2009-2010 school year through a grant from the Student Organizations Allocations Committee, this ensemble performs various Brazilian musical styles on concerts and events on campus and throughout the community.

Founded in 1916, the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences is one of only 31 colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States and Canada. It is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 vet schools in the country, according to U.S. News. The college offers an undergraduate program in Biomedical Sciences, a professional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, and numerous graduate programs relating to veterinary medicine and epidemiology.Mission statementAt the Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, we support collaboration and teamwork that develops today's discoveries into proactive solutions for the benefit of animal, environmental, and public health, through our teaching, research, service, and outreach-impacting every Texan, every day.HistoryThe first record of an attempt to teach veterinary science at the Agricultural & Mechanical College was made in the third session of the college in 1878-79 when the college surgeon, D. Port Smythe, M.D., was also listed on the faculty as professor of anatomy, physiology and hygiene. No course is described, however, and no further record is available to indicate that such a course was actually given.The catalog of the fourth session also mentions proposed lectures in veterinary science, concerned mainly with domestic animals, but again no formal record exists of any actual courses given at the time.In April 1888, the college received a state appropriation of twenty-five hundred dollars for equipping and operating a Department of Veterinary Science, and on June 6, 1888, Dr. Mark Francis received his formal appointment to the faculty. This marked the real beginning of professional veterinary medicine in Texas; Francis was the first trained veterinarian at the college and would become one of the most distinguished men in United States veterinary medicine.", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "talking_about_count": 2, "name": "Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Texas-AM-College-of-Veterinary-Medicine-Biomedical-Sciences/109473875737530", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77840", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.3524093518, "state": "TX", "street": "", "latitude": 30.6128288001}, "were_here_count": 144, "is_community_page": true, "checkins": 144, "id": "109473875737530", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Education", "username": "tamuroses", "about": "Meeting the challenges of our environment by mining the vast genetic diversity that exists in the genus Rosa. ", "talking_about_count": 24, "likes": 296, "description": "The TAMU Rose Breeding and Genetics Program has been blessed by the contributions of two outstanding rose breeders: Robert E. Basye and Ralph Moore. It is dedicated to fulfill their visions and maintain their legacies in the pursuit of sustainable rose varieties and establishing a Center of Excellence for Rose and Ornamental Breeding and Genetics.\n\nThe Rose Research Program at Texas A&M University began in the early 1990s when Robert Basye, a retired Texas A&M University mathematician and dedicated rose breeder, came to the Department of Horticultural Sciences about continuing the work to which he had devoted his life time. His major goal was to produce \u201chealthy rose bushes on which to hang those beautiful flowers\u201d well adapted to our humid hot climate.  He had a few roses released such as \u201cBelinda\u2019s Dream\u201d, \u201cBasye\u2019s Blueberry\u201d, Basye\u2019s Legacy\u201d, and \u201cBasye\u2019s Purple\u201d.\n\nThe Rose research program at TAMU focused on the development of heat tolerant and black spot resistant roses. Over the years we have collected roses, both commercial and wild species, and collaborated with Brent Pemberton at the AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Overton in their evaluation for adaptation and particularly their resistance to black spot. This effort continues.\n\nOther research the program has done includes 1.) improved procedures to germinate rose seed, 2.) the use of black spot resistant rose species in the development of black spot resistant commercial roses 3.) the examination of rose genetic diversity to better understand the origin and relationships among roses 4.) the genetic analyses to elucidate the inheritance of various traits 5.) the development of a genetic map and tools useful in improving our breeding approaches and the 6.) evaluation of roses for their heat tolerance (ability to flower well in the Texas summer).\n\nThe breeding work with Dr. Basye\u2019s rose germplasm has resulted various thornless roses with good disease resistance, a highly fragrant rose with good disease resistance, and some highly floriferous black spot resistant selections. Unfortunately, although these are nice roses the range of colors and flower types was limited. Fortunately, the Rose Program has recently received a gift of roses from Ralph Moore who is known throughout the world as the Father of the Miniature Rose. This was a perfect match because the Basye rose germplasm has good disease resistance but it does not have the diversity of ornamental traits that Ralph Moore had put together over his 70 year career. Initial work combining these rose groups has resulted in such releases such as as \u201cGina\u2019s Rose\u201d and \u201cMy Stars\u201d.  \n\nRalph Moore\u2019s purpose with this gift to Texas A&M University was to strengthen the existing rose breeding program so it could preserve and use the rose germplasm that he had developed over his long career and expand what we know about the rose. Ralph always approached any breeding challenge with the question, \u201cWhy not?\u201d.  He was an explorer and was always encouraging others to explore. This is what the TAMU program is dedicated to do as it works with the public, visiting scientists, and students through its Center of Excellence for Rose and Ornamental Breeding and Genetics. \n\nAs both Robert Basye and Ralph Moore believed, the best way to continue with their long term goal of developing environmentally friendly and beautiful rose cultivars was to establish a privately endowed program at a University where the torch can be past.

Just imagine tapping into such a network for career opportunities upon graduation\u2026.\n\nYou are highly encouraged to check it out and share this information with your friends.

{"category": "Health/medical/pharmaceuticals", "username": "TAMUVET", "talking_about_count": 12, "description": "You are encouraged to share your comments, ideas, and concerns on the Veterinary Emergency Team Facebook fan page, but please be aware of our posting policies, which can be found at http://vetmed.tamu.edu/facebook\n\nThe Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences has a long history of lending a helping hand in times of emergency.  During Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, the Large Animal Hospital was converted to a special needs surge hospital and provided a safe haven from the storm for in excess of 350 special needs patients.  Faculty, staff and students performed a variety of different roles during this emergency and were a driving force behind this effort.  In addition, faculty, staff and students also participated in organizing and running a companion animal emergency shelter in Brazos County.  This shelter ultimately provided shelter for in excess of 700 companion animals evacuated from the coastal regions of Texas.\n\nDuring the post-Katrina era, faculty became actively involved in developing emergency response plans at the county level.  Clinical faculty from the departments of Small Animal and Large Animal Clinical Sciences assumed leadership roles on the Large Animal and Small Animal Issues Committees.  The primary responsibility tasked to these committees was development of emergency animal sheltering plans for animals evacuated from the coast of Texas during hurricane landfalls.  These plans marked the beginnings of combining emergency service and education for the senior veterinary students.\n\nIn 2008 Hurricane Ike provided the opportunity for implementation of the emergency animal sheltering plans.  Nearly 200 large animals were evacuated from the coast and housed at the Brazos County Emergency Shelter.  Students were intimately involved and played a significant role in the shelter\u2019s success.  Hurricane Ike also demonstrated that increased veterinary capacity was needed in the emergency response structure.  The Texas Animal Health Commission, the lead agency in emergency response on behalf of animals at the state level, requested that the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences provide this additional capacity.\n\nFaculty and staff of the College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences developed plans to provide an emergency response team and the Texas A&M Veterinary Emergency Team was formed.  Federal funding provided the initial start-up funding.  These funds were used to develop a mobile and self-sufficient veterinary triage hospital which can be deployed around the state with the triage hospital being staffed by veterinary faculty, senior veterinary students and staff members.  In addition to federal funding, the Veterinary Emergency Team has received funding from Coufal-Praytor Inc., John Deere, Inc, and the American Association of Equine Practitioners Foundation.  The combination of public and private funding has provided critical support allowing the Veterinary Emergency Team to reach a deployable status.  The TAMU VET now has a fleet of specialized trailers ranging from 21 to 53 feet and a deployable and self-contained hospital unit.  \n\nOur largest trailer is REV-1, a 53 foot semi-trailer built by Western Shelters. REV-1 is equipped with a 100kw generator capable of providing electrical power to our entire field hospital system.  This trailer will be used to house the command and control center, as well as a 4-bay animal treatment area.  REV-2 is a specialized mobile surgical unit, capable of providing a suitable environment for performing surgery in remote locations.  Within REV-2 is a complete surgical suite with scrub sink, recovery area, and a lab area capable of preserving DNA tissue of endangered or valuable animals. REV-2 is also completely self-sustainable.  REV-3 is a 38- foot multiple platform trailer which is fitted with an 18kw generator and two fully functional bath suites.  REV-3 can provide beds for fifteen or can be easily converted into an additional treatment area. The eleven Western Shelters tents can be used for a variety of applications.  When the need requires a field veterinary hospital, the VET has the ability to build a hospital to the specifications of a particular incident with tents fully heated or cooled and with hot and cold water capabilities.\n\nIn September of 2011, the VET deployed to their first natural disaster, the Bastrop Complex Fire.  The team was deployed with Texas Task Force One and through the care of the VET, the search and rescue dogs were able to work six consecutive days and complete their assigned mission in a state of exceptional physical health.  This consisted of twice daily physical exams, subcutaneous or intravenous fluids to keep the dogs hydrated in the heat, and daily foot bandaging to protect the pads of the dogs from the searing heat of the ash as they worked.  A second component of our mission was to triage and stabilize injured and ill animals affected by the disaster.   This aspect of our mission benefitted from a partnership with Austin Humane Society and Bastrop Animal Control Units.   This partnership eased the pain and suffering of over 150 animals as well as provided relief for the shelters and local veterinary hospitals.  These two separate missions made the inaugural deployment of the  VET an over-whelming success and proved that an animal response is needed in disasters.\n\nTogether with local, state, and federal authorities, the VET is an important part of the animal response in disasters that affect our communities.\n\nTo learn more about VET, please visit: http://vetmed.tamu.edu/vet\n\nIf you would like to donate towards the VET, please visit: http://vetmed.tamu.edu/vet/giving\n\nOr contact:\n\nWesley T.

Sociology majors frequently enter such diverse fields as law enforcement, counseling, probation work, social service occupations, marketing analysis, human relations, casework, demography, and business.\ufeff\n\nCriminology\nCriminology is an interdisciplinary social-behavioral science which includes systematic study in the theory of crime, social foundations of criminal behavior, theories of punishment, and social structural components of the legal and criminal justice systems. The program uses a social-psychological model of focus on the etiology of crime, criminal behavior, and societal reaction to crime. Criminology majors may enter occupational fields such as law enforcement, correctional counseling, probation and parole work, immigration and naturalization services, investigative services, institutional corrections, and community-based corrections.\n\nSouthwest Borderland Studies: Minors\nThe Southwest Borderlands Research Center offers minors in both of its component areas, Mexican American Studies and Southwest Borderlands Studies, in conjunction with the Departments of Geosciences, History, Language and Literature, Political Science, Psychology and Sociology, and the Colleges of Agriculture and Human Sciences, Business Administration, and Engineering.\n\nMinors in Mexican American Studies are required to complete 18 semester hours of courses related to Mexican Americans, including SWBS 2301. Students electing to minor in Southwest Borderlands Studies are required to take SWBS 2302, SWBS 4302, and SWBS 4304 to complete 18 semester hours of courses related to borderlands development. No more than 9 semester hours in any department may apply toward the minor in either area of concentration.\n\n\nAnthropology: Minor\nAnthropology is a discipline in the social sciences which focuses on the comparative study of human behavior and cultures. Anthropology asks, \u201cWhat makes human beings so distinct? How have we changed over time? What factors (biology, culture, etc.) influence the ways we behave? How can we understand the increasing interconnections among societies and the differences between us?\u201d To get at these questions, anthropologists study almost everything, from garbage to monkeys to HIV/AIDS to multinational corporations.\n\nAnthropology is made up of four subfields: archaeology, physical anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and cultural anthropology. Each subfield approaches the study of human behavior from a unique perspective, but all the subfields share common goals in understanding what it means to be human.\n\nCourses in Anthropology examine human similarity and difference through case studies of cultural diversity around the globe and through time. They emphasize the applications of anthropology in understanding present-day social issues like inequality, race, gender, class, families, migration, borders, warfare, communication, ecology, health and medicine.\n\nAnthropology shares close ties with the humanities, natural sciences, and even business fields. With its broad perspective and emphasis on critical, cross-cultural thinking, anthropology is widely applicable in many fields of study. Anthropology students go on to use their analytical strength and cultural breadth in many career paths, including public service, law enforcement, business, marketing, healthcare, and education.\n\nTexas A&M University-Kingsville\nDepartment of Psychology and Sociology\nMSC 177, Room 120\nKingsville, Texas 78363\nEmail: psycsoci@tamuk.edu \nvoice: (361) 593-2701\nfax: (361) 593-2707", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "were_here_count": 2, "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/1380317_723908557622750_1908582760_n.jpg", "cover_id": "723908557622750", "offset_x": 71, "offset_y": 0}, "mission": "The Department of Psychology and Sociology is committed to the goals of a liberal education emphasizing human growth and intellectual development through an understanding of individual behavior, social interaction and cultural awareness at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

It was an enhanced version of the less successful TI-99/4 model, which was released in late 1979 at a price of $1,150. The TI-99/4A added an additional graphics mode, \"lowercase\" characters consisting of small capitals, and a full travel keyboard. Its predecessor, the TI-99/4, featured a calculator-style chiclet keyboard and a character set that lacked lowercase text.FeaturesThe TI-99/4A's CPU, motherboard, and cartridge (\"Solid State Software\") slot were built into a single console, along with the keyboard. The power regulator board is housed below and in front of the cartridge slot under the sloped area to the right of the keyboard. This area gets very hot so users commonly refer to it as the \"coffee cup warmer\". The external power supply, which was different according to the country of sale, was merely a step-down transformer.Available peripherals included a 5\u00bc\" floppy disk drive and controller, an RS-232 card comprising two serial ports and one parallel port, a P-code card for Pascal support, a thermal printer, an acoustic coupler, a tape drive using standard audio cassettes as media, and a 32 KB memory expansion card.

In addition, they are taught to be diligent workers, honest at all times, and orderly and organized.\n\nSocial Education ~ the development of the student's academic, character and social maturity is a task shared jointly by the family and A.W.Brown-Fellowship.

This first Texas lodge was called Holland Lodge No. 36. It was named after then Grand Master of Masons in Louisiana,  John Henry Holland. Anson Jones was the first Worshipful Master of Holland Lodge No. 36, now Holland Lodge No. 1. The charter was brought by John M.

They were: Milam Lodge No. 40 in Nacogdoches, and McFarland Lodge No. 41 in San Augustine. Both were formed in 1837. These two lodges, together with Holland Lodge No. 36, sent representatives to meet in Houston and established the Grand Lodge of the Republic of Texas.  The convention elected Anson Jones the first Grand Master of Masons in Texas. It should be noted that Anson Jones was the fourth and final President of the Republic of Texas, prior to becoming a state.\n \nToday there are over 90,000 Masons in Texas and more than 800 lodges.

It was while volunteering for several years at an 1800 living history museum, that I became more appreciative of the skills that our ancestors had in order to survive. \n\nOne day after tending the wood burning stove in the sweltering Texas heat, I sat at the table for a moment to fan my face, while three women in shorts and tee shirts stopped by the kitchen to look upon me with pity. I was wearing the long skirt and sleeves of a pioneer woman of the 1880\u2019s, waiting for my soup to boil. From an opened window, I could see the children tossing scraps of potato peelings over to the pigs.  \nIt was another public school touring of Pioneer Farms, and the teacher\u2019s lingered in the doorway to ask me questions. I got a whiff of their perfume, as I wiped the sweat from my brow with the back of my sleeve. We discussed how our ancestors survived without electricity, plumbing and running water. \nA teacher proclaimed that she absolutely couldn\u2019t cope without her microwave. I simply asked, \u201cWhat if you didn\u2019t have electricity, would you still want your microwave?\u201d \n\nI ask myself that same question every day after volunteering at the farm. It was like stepping out of a time tunnel. I\u2019d marvel at the fast food restaurants, or that I could stop at a convenience store for an ice cold soda pop. Then I\u2019d walk into my artificially air conditioned home and enjoy the comforts of a hot shower, the TV, and a microwave dinner. It was pure luxury, yet deep down I longed for the simpler things in life -- A life without mortgage payments, high utility bills, and focusing more on my family, rather than keeping up with the Joneses. \nConcern for the economy has kept me in both time periods. I\u2019ve been cleaning my house of nonsense and making my kitchen more functional. I now buy oil lamps, stocking up on candles and teaching myself to can, and cook more from scratch. For food storage I try not to rely on my refrigerator too much. It\u2019s a \u201cdon\u2019t put all your eggs into one basket\u201d mentality for me. In a flash, we could all be living without the very things we take for granted. I\u2019m trying to be more self-reliant with a make-do attitude.\n I\u2019ve done away with pesticides, and learned to appreciate natures remedy for pests. I focus now on organic gardening, saving seeds, raising chickens and composting. I find \u201cfarming\u201d on less than \u00bc of an acre in town as very challenging and rewarding.  No longer do I dream of a cookie cutter life in the suburbs. My goal is to live as fully and as simply as I can, never taking for granted the things that I have.\n", "talking_about_count": 0, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/625424_466500586736615_457427709_n.jpg", "cover_id": "466500586736615", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 49}, "name": "A Slice of Texas", "website": "A SLICE OF TEXAS - http://sluglines.blogspot.com/", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/ASliceofTexas", "likes": 224, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "466494163403924", "is_published": true}

The School is ranked by U.S. News and World Reports as a Top 25 Graduate School in Public Health, with the average age of Schools ranked above them 40+ years. The school is also annually ranked among the top five schools of public health in student diversity.The School provides an excellent forum for tomorrow's public health leaders to engage in a learning environment that builds on a wide array of research strengths and scholarly inquire of a stellar faculty (every year for the last six years a faculty member has received the prestigious designation of Regents Professor). Further, the research and practice links established by the faculty provide an extensive diversity of opportunities for students to work closely with professionals in applied public health settings. Students pursue degrees at both the master's and doctoral levels. The practice focused Master in Public Health (MPH) degree is offered in the five core disciplines of Public Health (Epidemiology, Biostatistics, Environmental and Occupational Health, Social and Behavioral Health, and Policy and Management) and in a unique Border Health program centered at our McAllen campus. The research focused Master of Science in Public Health (MSPH) degree is available in the five core disciplines as well. The school offers what may be the nation's premier Master in Health Administration (MHA) program for those seeking career opportunities in rural settings, although our graduates can be found in many urban settings from Dallas and Houston, to New York City and Los Angeles. The MHA program is one of only 10 nationally participating in the National Center for Health Care Leadership program designed to refine curricula by linking instructional objectives to practice-based competencies and was also recently ranked as a top program by U.S. News and World Reports. Doctoral programs are offered in Health Services Research (PhD), Social and Behavioral Sciences (DrPH) and Epidemiology and Environmental Health (DrPH). We also have several collaborative programs in place (e.g., MD/MPH, 4+1 programs with pre-med, agriculture and the undergraduate health academy at Prairie View A&M University) or in development (e.g., MSN/MPH, PharmD/MPH). SRPH was competitively selected by the U.S. Army Medical Department Center and School to provide training to military personnel in the Department of Preventive Health Services Principles in the Army Preventive Medicine program, a collaborative graduate program at Ft.

Membership doubled again in 2009 despite all 3 founding members graduating.\n\nThe new leaders brought change and growth in 2009. A partnership with Living Water International was formed and the name was changed to \"The Wells Project.\" After another successful Two Weeks campaign, Living Water International hired a Wells Project founder to the position of University Coordinator in 2010.\n\nBehind the strength of The Wells Project Texas A&M and its 50+ members, LWI began efforts to engage students on other campuses using the TWP model and a revamped campaign called 10 Days. For 10 Days, students and members of our communities make water their only beverage. We save what we would normally spend on coffee, sodas, and other drinks, and donate it together to fund clean water wells. The 2011 10 Days campaign yielded around $70,000 for clean water wells in Rwanda.\n\nIn 2012, The Wells Project Texas A&M is leading the charge of the growing number of chapters of passionate college students across the country toward the mission of changing lives through clean water.\n", "id": "176536798932", "is_published": true}

We seek to do this by running an unplugged, student led 24-hour period of continuous praise, worship, prayer, and evangelism in Rudder Plaza. This is an incredible opportunity to make the name of Jesus known to the Texas A&M community as we\u2019ll be in such a central part of campus that we\u2019ll come in contact with a huge portion of the student population. \n\nWe are looking for volunteers for two things: to lead worship and to pray and proclaim the Gospel. For worship, we need people to play instruments (guitar, keyboard, djembe, cajon, etc.) and sing for a 30 minute or maybe an hour time slot. You are welcome to sign up as an ensemble or to lead solo though we would restrict it to purely acoustic music (keyboards are fine but no full band electric guitar and smoke machine stuff). You don't need to be the greatest singer in the world; we just want people who will lead God\u2019s people in worship through song. You will sign up at the link above for all times you are available to lead worship and we will email you back with your time slot as the event approaches. Other than that you are given the freedom to worship how God leads you. \n\nSecondly, we want you to sign up to pray and evangelize. While worship may be the \"in the spotlight\" part of Heart of Worship, the event presents an incredible opportunity to reach out to those who are not followers of Jesus and to encourage those who are. I know witnessing or evangelizing to others may seem intimidating or frightening, but we aren't asking you to just walk and up spit the gospel out at them and leave. Our vision is that you would walk around the people that are watching or walking through Rudder Plaza and talk with them. Explain what this is and why we are having worship here. Ask how you can pray for them and pray with them. Share the gospel in conversation. Invite them to church. Your time out there may look like only one of those things, or it may look completely different, but we are asking you to come devote some of your time to encouraging and spreading the Gospel with us. You are also more than welcome to lead worship AND sign up to pray. We strongly encourage it. So go to the link above to sign up for the time slots you can come. There are no restrictions on how many people sign up for a time slot, though we hope to have multiple people in every slot. Also, if you don\u2019t sign up for a time slot, but you realize, \u201cHey I\u2019ve got some time and I want to use it productively and go to Heart of Worship\u201d COME DO IT!\n\nThank you for all your time, we can't wait to see how the Lord moves through Heart of Worship", "talking_about_count": 0, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn1/t1.0-9/s720x720/1012131_554490347983394_1523146546_n.jpg", "cover_id": "554490347983394", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0}, "name": "Heart of Worship: Texas A&M", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/heartofworshiptamu", "likes": 202, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "471516129614150", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Non-profit organization", "username": "pdttxrho", "about": "\"To do what ought to be done but what would not have been done unless I did it, I thought to be my duty\"- Brother Robert Morrison, Founder of Phi Delta Theta", "talking_about_count": 8, "name": "Phi Delta Theta: Texas A&M University-Corpus Christi", "company_overview": "The Beginning\nAs the Christmas holidays approached in 1848, the atmosphere on the Miami campus in Oxford, Ohio was gloomy and uncertain. This was the mood in which Robert Morrison suggested to a close friend and classmate, John McMillian Wilson, that they consider putting together a new collegiate brotherhood.\n\nFrom this elemental beginning, Phi Delta Theta evolved into the positive international force for good it has become over the past 159 years.\n\n\"The Immortal Six\" - Founding Fathers\n\n\nMorrison and Wilson, thinking in terms of providing a permanent base with growth potential, sought out underclassman they visualized as joining them. Thus juniors John Wolfe Lindley and Robert Thompson Drake were approached, as were sophomores Ardivan Walker Rogers and Andrew Watts Rogers, all of who accepted the concept.\n\nAll six men were among the depleted ranks of Miami students who did not attempt to go home to join their families for the Christmas holidays because of the difficult travel conditions and bitter winter weather.\n\nThe need for close companionship had to be evident when the six met the night of December 26, 1848 in Wilson\u2019s second floor room in Old North Hall, directly above Morrison\u2019s room. They firmed up their desire to establish a brotherhood.\n\nThey met two nights later in the same room to consider an appropriate motto and constitution. Morrison and Wilson put the consensus ideas into terminology that became The Bond that every initiate has signed to become a member of the Fraternity.\n\nOn December 30, the \u201cImmortal Six\u201d put their signatures to The Bond of the Phi Delta Theta in Wilson\u2019s room in Elliott Hall. Their names remain a vital part of the rituals that continue today in every chapter room across the United States and Canada. The Bond has remained unchanged from that day to this. So far as it is known, it is the only document of any fraternity of such a character, and it is easy to understand the veneration with which all Phis regard it.\n\nThe first branch of Phi Delta Theta was established at Indiana University in October of 1849 and other chapters followed at Centre College and Wabash College. The real growth occurred during the two decades from 1870 to 1890 due principally to the efforts of Walter B. Palmer, Emory-Vanderbilt 1877, and George Banta, Franklin-Indiana 1876. The two were given the title Second Founders for their work.\n\nAn International Fraternity\n\n\nIn 1900, twelve students at McGill University submitted a charter application. The request was presented at the General Convention in November where it was decided to grant the charter. At the installation of Quebec Alpha on April 5, 1902, a toast to the King was followed by a toast to the President and Phi Delta Theta was hence forth known as an international fraternity. The Fraternity continued to extend its presence in Canada, eventually stretching from coast to coast.\n\nThe Leader in the Fraternity World\n\n\nPhi Delta Theta was the first Fraternity to create an endowment for free lifetime subscriptions to the Fraternity magazine called The Scroll, a plan later adopted by nearly every other fraternal organization. Phi Delta Theta was also the first to adopt a pledge button and the first to publish a pledge manual.\n\nPhi Delta Theta members have occupied every major public office including the presidency and vice presidency of the United States, Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, U.S. Senators and Congressmen, State Governors and Senators in the Canadian House of Commons. Phi Delta Theta also holds the unique distinction of having Brother Neil Armstrong as the first man on the moon. \n\nThe Fraternity continued to grow and expand surviving tough times such as war, the Great Depression, and the civil rights movement. The 1980s changed the way Fraternities conducted business with new legal charges in suits involving alcohol abuse, hazing, and discrimination. Fraternity insurance and risk management programs were born and new educational program initiatives were directed at combating these issues to ensure the safety and well being of our members.\n\nPhi Delta Theta reaffirmed its leadership role in the late 1990s when it voted to eliminate alcohol from chapter facilities by the year 2000. Based on this new movement, the Fraternity has undergone one of its largest growth spurts in the history of the modern Fraternity. This indicates a renewed demand for a values-based organization from college students. Phi Delta Theta continues to be a model for other Greek organizations looking to make the same positive move.\n\nPhi Delta Theta now has nearly 160 active chapters in 43 states and five Canadian provinces. The Fraternity has initiated more than 228,000 men and currently has more than 142,000 living alumni. There are over 100 recognized alumni clubs across the U.S. and Canada.\n\nThe Fraternity operates from the General Headquarters building on South Campus Avenue, across from Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. At the corner of the campus closest to headquarters, memorial gates were erected in honor of the Fraternity's 125th anniversary\n", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1654459_10152224907138194_614860853_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10152224907138194", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 100}, "mission": "Friendship\nSound Learning\nMoral Rectitude", "founded": "Nationally: December 26, 1848.

{"category": "Movie", "description": "The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is a 1974 American slasher film, directed and produced by Tobe Hooper, who cowrote it with Kim Henkel. It stars Marilyn Burns, Paul A. Partain, Edwin Neal, Jim Siedow and Gunnar Hansen, who respectively portray Sally Hardesty, Franklin Hardesty, the hitchhiker, the proprietor and Leatherface, the main antagonist. The film follows a group of friends who fall victim to a family of cannibals while on their way to visit an old homestead. Although it was marketed as a true story to attract a wider audience and as a subtle commentary on the era's political climate, its plot is entirely fictional; however the character of Leatherface and minor plot details were inspired by the crimes of real-life murderer Ed Gein.Hooper produced the film for less than $300,000 and used a cast of relatively unknown actors drawn mainly from central Texas, where the film was shot. The limited budget forced Hooper to film for long hours seven days a week, so that he could finish as quickly as possible and reduce equipment rental costs. Due to the film's violent content, Hooper struggled to find a distributor. Louis Perano of Bryanston Pictures eventually purchased the distribution rights. Hooper limited the quantity of onscreen gore in hopes of securing a 'PG' rating, but the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) rated it 'R'. The film faced similar difficulties internationally.", "talking_about_count": 3, "name": "Texas Chain Saw Massacre", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Texas-Chain-Saw-Massacre/108232112540979", "likes": 10341, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "108232112540979", "is_published": true}

They could take blood pressures, and that was about it. It was just a huge ordeal, so we created Disaster Day to prepare our students for these types of disaster situations.\u201d\n\n This community need was realized by the Texas A&M Health Science Center President, Nancy Dickey, and resulted in a carefully planned and entirely structured disaster simulation coordinated by students and faculty from the College of Nursing starting in 2008. A recent addition to the event includes participation from TAMHSC-College of Medicine and Irma Lerma Rangel College of Pharmacy, as well as Blinn College nursing, radiology, and EMS students to encourage an interdisciplinary learning experience.\n\nThis emergency disaster simulation teaches students to work under high pressure and chaotic situations. Over 400 patient-actor volunteers, ranging from newborns to the elderly, participate with assigned health scenarios including internal bleeding, respiratory distress, fractures, and certainly emotional distress. From symptoms that appear out of nowhere to wailing children, this high adrenaline experience is authentic to an actual disaster. \n\nThe setting for the disaster is a temporary medical needs shelter that fills with patients turned away from full hospitals, ERs, and emergency clinics. The actual simulation represents a slice in time so that the students are entering the shelter to patients needing assistance immediately. Simulations done in the past have included hurricanes, wildfires, explosions, and chemical fires. \n\nThis year will mark the 7th Annual Disaster Simulation put on by TAMHSC-College of Nursing. We invite you to consider a role you could have in this enriching educational experience by volunteering as one of the 400+ patient-actors needed, donating supplies or monetary gifts, etc.  \n\n\u201cI almost forgot that they were medical students.  They already looked like real nurses and doctors,\u201d Dillon Livingston said. \u201cAnd that makes me feel safe. Because I know that one day they\u2019ll be taking care of other people.\u201d\n\n\nThe 2014 Disaster Day is set for Thursday, March 20th.

Jon Williams and Mike Cousineau were determined to express their innate \u201cTexan-ness\u201d while being deployed, and the Facebook page seemed like the perfect outlet. After a lengthy deployment Jon, along with his wife decided to expand I Am A Texan to the website it is today, with the dreams that it will be the go-to web destination for Texans everywhere.\n\nThere are many outlets promoting commerce, but very few that are Texans promoting Texans. IAmATexan.com was designed to address this exact issue. We developed the website in hopes that Texans and Texas businesses connect with one another in a friendly and dynamic fashion.\n\nJon\u2019s love for Texas can be tracked back 6 generations \u2013 all the way to the Alamo. Coincidentally, his family\u2019s military service and the love for their country go all the way back to the War of 1812. Serving five years in the United States Army himself, he is now working in defense out of El Paso, Texas. Jon holds a Bachelors degree from the University of North Texas and is currently pursuing his Masters from Texas A&M. Many Central Texans from around the Waco area are familiar with his voice, as he worked as a broadcaster in both radio and television at KXXV News 25 Waco, KPLE TBN Killeen, 88.9 KSUR and 89.9 KBDE Waco. Naturally, Jon was looking for his perfect Texas sweetheart, but God had different plans. After returning home from yet another deployment, fate stepped in and Jon met his wife at a Braves game in Atlanta, Georgia. It was not far after that they were married and Kasha was living the Texas life.\n\nOUR GUARANTEE\n\n\nAs you browse our website and our General Store, you can rest assured that all the products are Made in the USA, most are 100% Made in Texas with a few having some portions of the supply chain resting outside our great state, but there are no foreign made items in our store. Each of our vendors signs an affadavit to that effect, and they promise to hire Texans as they grow their business. That's as Texan as it gets. \n\nWe pride ourselves in excellent customer service because we treat every visitor as our friend. Kasha and Jon work very hard to try and make everyone happy between the craziness of raising two small children and working their day jobs. Please know that we are real people behind the website and we always put ourselves in the position of our customers, as we are customers too! We understand how it feels like to anxiously wait for a package, how happy we are when something is better than pictured online, or how upset we are when that item came damaged or incorrect.\n\nFOR TEXANS, BY TEXANS\n\nNow that you know more about us, we hope that you will catch the vision we have to help Texan-owned businesses connect with Texas consumers. We thank you for your visit to our website, and hope that we can exceed your expectations on a daily basis.\n\nIn a time of political and economic concern, America is thirsty for domestic commerce. A documentary Jon watched a few years ago stated that if every American would spend just $100 per year on American made goods, American jobs could be created for about three million people. I Am A Texan\u2019s vision is that economic revolution can happen right here in Texas.

Known to the Aggie community simply as \"Bonfire\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \"burning desire to beat the hell outta <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glossary_of_Texas_Aggie_terms%23T\" class=\"wikipedia\">t.u.</a>\", a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas. The bonfire was traditionally lit around <a href=\"/pages/w/112777102105227\">Thanksgiving</a> in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual <a href=\"/pages/w/106154982748155\">college football</a> game.</p><h2>Early years</h2><p>The students of the <a href=\"/pages/w/142786159070646\">Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas</a>, known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907 to congratulate the <a href=\"/pages/w/108191589208352\">football team</a> on a recent win. The first <a href=\"/pages/w/126952260681672\">on-campus</a> Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&M and the University of Texas, held near <a href=\"/pages/w/110764878951827\">Thanksgiving Day</a>. Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&M yearbook mentioned the \"final rally\" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event.</p>", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "talking_about_count": 1, "name": "Texas A&M Bonfire Memorial", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Texas-AM-Bonfire-Memorial/138407952872873", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77840", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.335274057726, "state": "TX", "street": "", "latitude": 30.622465128042}, "were_here_count": 1958, "is_community_page": true, "checkins": 1958, "id": "138407952872873", "is_published": true}

It is the flagship institution of the Texas A&M University System, the fourth-largest university in the United States and the largest university in Texas. Texas A&M's designation as a land, sea, and space grant institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research. The school ranks in the top 20 American research institutes in terms of funding and has made notable contributions to such fields as animal cloning and petroleum engineering.The first public institution of higher education in Texas, though not the first general university in the state, the school opened on October 4, 1876 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas under the provisions of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts. Originally, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature. Under the leadership of President James Earl Rudder, in the 1960s A&M desegregated, became coeducational, and dropped the requirement for participation in the Corps of Cadets. To reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings, the Texas Legislature renamed the school to Texas A&M University in 1963. The letters \"A&M\", originally short for \"Agricultural and Mechanical\", are retained only as a link to the university's past. The school's students, alumni, and sports teams are known as \"Aggies\".", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "talking_about_count": 2, "name": "TAMU", "phone": "979.845.3211", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/TAMU/110176805678075", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.344056, "state": "TX", "street": "", "latitude": 30.610369}, "were_here_count": 6, "is_community_page": true, "checkins": 6, "id": "110176805678075", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Community organization", "can_post": true, "description": "The Gurung is an ethnic group from the Central region of Nepal. They live primarily in West Nepal\u2019s Gandaki zone, specifically Lamjung, Kaski, Tanahu, Gorkha, Parbat and Syangja districts as well as the Manang district around the Annapurna mountain range. Some live in the Baglung, Okhaldhunga and Taplejung districts and Machhapuchhre as well. Small numbers are believed to be living in Sikkim or Bhutan. \n\nAs of 2001, there are 543,571 Gurung (\u03a4em\u00fc) (2.39% of Nepal's total population) of which 338,925 speak Tem\u00fc-Tan. \n\nOrigin\n\nThe Gurung believed that Lamjung, Kaski and Gorkha are the birth places of their community. \nSome anthropologists deduced that the Gurung, Tamu (also spelled Temu) are descended from the historical pre-Mongol, Hun people of Central Asia, and spread and settled in Nepal they came to be known as Gurung. Others argued that they are of more recent Mongol migrations.\n\"Pye-tan-lhu-tan\" is the sacred scripture of the Gurung, which contain oral accounts of their traditional history. \nThough only about half a million in number, the Gurung people have made distinct and immense contributions to history and culture and have demonstrated an unwavering commitment to world peace and progress. At present, the majority of Gurungs live in Nepal, where they form one of the many ethnic groups in the country. In Nepal, Gurungs have and continue to play significant roles in all spheres of the country\u2019s development. Outside Nepal, many Gurungs, some in their renowned role as Gurkha soldiers, have lived and been exposed to diverse world cultures in areas as different as Bhutan, Europe, Hong-Kong, India, Japan, Korea, and the United States of America. \n\nIn Nepal, Gurungs can be divided into two categories, highlanders and lowlanders (though Gurungs are predominantly highlanders). Highlanders living on the slopes of Himalayas still rely heavily on a pastoral and agricultural way of life. They grow rice, wheat, maize, millet and potatoes, normally on terraced mountain slopes. They also derive subsistence from sheep breeding for meat and wool, using fierce mastiffs as sheepdogs. The highlanders\u2019 way of life resembles that of Tibetans in terms of religious beliefs and cultural practices. In contrast, lowlanders are more influenced by Hindu religious beliefs and practices. It is not surprising to see Gurungs using a Hindu priest for birth and a Buddhist Lama (priest) for last rites at someone\u2019s death. \n\nMany Gurung families, however, have another important source of income - the pensions and salaries of family members who are in the army. Among them are the legendry fighters of the British Gurkha Regiment, who were honored with Victoria Crosses for their bravery. Indeed Gurungs are renowned for their role as Gurkha soldiers, making unparalleled contributions in far flung places such as Europe during World Wars I and II, Burma, Malaysia, the Falklands, Africa, and India. Most recently, Gurungs have participated and continue to participate in most United Nations peacekeeping missions throughout the world. \n\nDespite many pushes and pulls of modern day life, Gurungs are increasingly eager to learn, preserve, and celebrate their distinct cultural heritage and practices. This includes not only the various belief systems and cultural practices surrounding festivals, birth, marriage, and death rituals, but also the Gurungs\u2019 own language Tamu Kwei, generally considered a Tibeto-Burman dialect. This focus on Gurung culture continues to provide invaluable insights and inspiration toward the future. \n\nIn an ever more interdependent world, Gurungs face the challenge of balancing the preservation of their unique cultural heritage with adaptation to the demands of modern life. The majority of Gurungs still struggle for basic opportunities to improve their livelihoods. As in the past, Gurungs need to invest in opportunities that build on their well-known attributes as people who are hard working, trustworthy, adaptable, and quick-learners in meeting the challenges of modern life in Nepal and beyond its boundaries. Gurungs seek support and guidance from individuals, institutions, and governments.\n\nLifestyle\n\nTheir traditional occupation was based on sheep herding and trans-Himalayan trade. In the 19th and early 20th century, many Gurung were recruited to serve in the British and Indian Gurkha regiments. Today, the Singapore Police, Brunei reserve units and the French Foreign Legion incorporate ethnically Gurung members. While serving in the British Army they have earned more than 6 Victoria's Cross awards. Gurungs are not only restricted to military occupations, many live in urban areas and are employed in all types of labor, business and professional services. \n\nGurungs trace their descent patrilineally, organized into two groups, or moieties of patrilineal clans.\nA noted Gurung tradition is the institution of Rodhi where teenagers form fictive kinship bonds and become Rodhi members to socialize, perform communal tasks, and find marriage partners.But the institution is rarely in existance because of its notoriusity in the community.'Rodhi' literally means weaving and making of baskets. \n\nReligion \n\nThe Gurung were followers of B\u00f6n shamanism. Tibetan Buddhism was later introduced to the Gurung. Today, the majority of the Gurung are followers of Tibetan Buddhism, especially those who live near the Buddhists. The influence of B\u00f6n shamanism is strong among many Gurung. According to the 2001 Nepal Census, 69.03% of the ethnic Gurung were Boudhists, 28.75% were Hindus and 0.66% were Christians. Hindu influence from the Nepali led to many Gurung practicing Tibetan Buddhism with influences from Hinduism as well as B\u00f6n. Pockets of Gurung who live among the Hindus have converted to Hinduism. \n\nGurung laguage \n\nHistory of Gurungs In 1958, Bernard Pignede, a French student of anthropology came to Nepal to study about Gurungs. He spent seven months in a Gurung village Mohoriya (Kaski, Gandaki) and traveled through many neighboring Gurung villages to do his research. He learned to speak tamu-kuwei (gurung dialect) and documented pretty much everything about the gurungs - their social structure, culture, religion, history, occupations, legends and myths. He translated pae, a ritual and religious pratice that one gurung generation has passed down to another for thousands of years. Pae conveys the oral history of gurungs and is considered very sacred. Unfortunately, Pignede died tragically in 1961 at age of 29. After his death, Professor Louis Dumont published Pegnede\u2019s work in 1966. The book was immediately recognized as a major contribution to the anthropology of the Himalayas. Later, two noted anthropoligists - Sarah Harrison and Alan Macfarlane ( www.alanmacfarlane.com ) translated it in English and published the first English version in 1993. Harrison and Macfarlane did further study of gurungs and added more to Pignede's work. The English version of book is called \"The Gurungs\", which is probably the most acclaimed research on Gurungs so far.

Prior to having my first child, I knew nothing about cooking. I bought cookbooks, became a member at Costco\u2019s and BJ\u2019s, and begin experimenting in the kitchen.\n\nNot only did I learn that I loved to cook, I also learned that America loves to eat! I started baking cookies and cakes for a local Head Start Program my children attended; and I would help my grandmother make sweet potato pie for the holidays. I cooked so much that family events and holidays became a regular at my house. People loved my food!\n \nMy fascination with cupcakes unraveled in a dream. I baked a scrumptious cookies n cream cupcake and a caramel apple pie cupcake. I woke up excited and ready to create my masterpiece.

Here students embark on a journey of self-discovery. They learn how to unlock their creative potential, become lifelong learners, intellectual leaders and knowledge creators.\n\nThe college is literally abuzz with creativity around the clock as its 1,900 students, 140 faculty and 59 professional staff engage in myriad design and multimedia projects focused on the transformation of the human environment. Space is in constant motion as students collaborate and concepts take form in sketches, paintings, computer simulations, models, photographs, sculptures and video.\n\nArchitectural installations and artwork are regularly erected, studied and deconstructed. The walls are papered with an ever-changing mosaic of project posters that are pinned up, rigorously reviewed, and taken down to make room for next review.\n\nWhile some students study alone in private nooks, computer labs or the college\u2019s reference library, others collaborate in studios, classrooms or the coffee shop. There are lectures, seminars, workshops, design charrettes, exhibits, concerts, film screenings, celebrations and special events \u2014 many planned and many impromptu.\n\nA cacophony of busy power tools and sophisticated machinery echoes from the college\u2019s woodshop where architectural models, furniture, artwork and special projects take shape. On the nearby prairie, the whirl and hum of a CNC router and plasma cutter denote more substantial structures in the works at the college\u2019s 12-acre Digital Fabrication Facility, referred to affectionately by students as the \u201cArchitecture Ranch.\u201d\n \nBecause the creativity and empathy with which each discipline is practiced has a profound influence on the quality of life in society, College of Architecture students are challenged to weave aesthetics, safety, function, financial feasibility, sustainability and environmental stewardship into the creative process.\n\nRecognizing that no single professional track or narrow specialization can adequately prepare tomorrow\u2019s building, design, planning and visualization professionals, the college is distinctive in offering a truly interdisciplinary curriculum. As one of the largest schools of its kind, housing all of the built environment disciplines, the college is uniquely suited to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research.\n\nIts rich and diverse research portfolio includes projects conducted in its four academic departments, through its multiple institutes, research centers and specialized laboratories, and in collaboration with other colleges and centers within the university and around the world. The college\u2019s Institute for Applied Creativity and five formally organized research centers \u2014 the CRS Center for Leadership and Management in the Design and Construction Industry, the Center for Housing and Urban Development, the Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center, the Center for Health Systems & Design, and the Center for Heritage Conservation \u2014 expand the public knowledge base of the industries and professions they serve while supporting specialized graduate certificate programs.\n\nAnd because we all live in a highly interconnected world, those pursuing an undergraduate degree at the college are required to spend a long semester away from Texas A&M University\u2019s College Station campus, either engaged in a professional internship or studying abroad in one of the college\u2019s well-established programs in Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom or elsewhere.", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1506904_10152253596825420_44185916_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10152253596825420", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50}, "name": "Texas A&M University College of Architecture", "website": "http://one.arch.tamu.edu/", "phone": "(979) 845-1222", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TAMU.architecture", "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "3137 TAMU", "zip": "77843-3137", "country": "United States"}, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "11950375419", "is_published": true}

It is commonly found in Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei, Singapore, and the Philippines . It is commonly described as \"packed rice\", although there are other types of similar packed rices such as lontong and bakchang.HistoryThe use of woven young palm leaves as a pouch to cook food is widespread in Maritime Southeast Asia, from Indonesia, Malaysia, to the Philippines. Ketupat is made from rice that has been wrapped in a woven palm leaf pouch and boiled. As the rice cooks, the grains expand to fill the pouch and the rice becomes compressed. This method of cooking gives the ketupat its characteristic form and texture of a rice dumpling.Local stories passed down through the generations have attributed the creation of this style of rice preparation to the seafarers' need to keep cooked rice from spoiling during long sea voyages. The coco leaves used in wrapping the rice are always shaped into a triangular or diamond form and stored hanging in bunches in the open air. The shape of the package facilitates moisture to drip away from the cooked rice while the coco leaves allow the rice to be aerated and at the same time prevent flies and insects from touching it.", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Ta'mu", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tamu/108543485844230", "likes": 2, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "108543485844230", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Musician/band", "bio": "Kitu Kohls is an American female recording artist from Bakersfield California. Her debut single \"It's the Way\" is produced and written by Kris Kohls who is one of rock's most accomplished drummers/musicians. Kris started out with his hometown Band \"Cradle of Thorns\" which spawned \"Videodrone\" signed by Korn's label Elementree Records. Kris and his five piece band \"Adema\" made headlines when they were signed with Arista Records. \"Adema\" was the first rock band signed by the record company's President L.A. Reid, and later went Gold.\n\nKitu's musical influences have helped shape her dynamic voice into a sound and style that brings the traditional 80's genre to the forefront fusing the original essence of Rock with subtle Metal undertones. Her influences are Pat Benatar, Sheila E., The Cranberries, Tina Marie, Tracy Bonham, Annie Lennox, Crosby Stills and Nash, Janis Joplin and many more. Kitu's sound is Pat Benatar meets Ozzy.\n\nKitu's musical background started when she was 11 years old. Classically trained in music theory since age 11, she studied flute, saxophone and drums. She performed in various girl groups however because of the unstable music industry, decided to hang it up. Upon entering the United States Air Force she performed with the United States Air Force Drum and Bugle Corp. Her voice is no stranger to classical training, having studied voice, dance and theatre it was apparent that she could not avoid being discovered as one of America's next prominent female artist.\n", "general_manager": "Kris Kohls", "name": "Kitu \"Tamu\" Kohls", "press_contact": "publicity@kriskohls.com", "hometown": "Bakersfield, California", "booking_agent": "admin@kriskohls.com", "can_post": true, "record_label": "KOHLSLAW MUSIC ", "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/1472966_630701613660739_1223042174_n.jpg", "cover_id": "630701613660739", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 11}, "id": "148638588533713", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kitu-Tamu-Kohls/148638588533713", "likes": 359, "influences": "Pat Benatar meets Ozzy Osborne, Sheila E., The Cranberries, Tina Marie, Tracy Bonham, Annie Lennox, Crosby Stills and Nash, Janis Joplin and many more.\n\n", "were_here_count": 0, "genre": "Rock", "talking_about_count": 1, "release_date": "May 13, 2011", "is_published": true}

Led by Alpha chapter transfer and charter line member Albert Navarro, the Men of Vision sought to bring ODPhi to A&M as they saw an immense need for a social outlet and support system for Latino and other men of color. The men of vision also saw a growing need for community service efforts and outreach in the Bryan/College Station area. \n\nThe Delta Chapter continues to impact the lives of the many men who have pledged and made an oath of brotherhood through ODPhi. ODPhi continues to attract campus leaders, social justice advocates, academically recognized students, and men with an overall vision of their goals and what they want to achieve in life. The standards have been set by those who came before and this is why ODPhi only accepts the best of the best; men who are committed to living in Unity, Honesty, Integrity, and Leadership, men who are ready to work for their community and be their brother's keeper at all times. \n\nAlthough founded primarily by men of Hispanic descent in a time of political and social unrest at Texas A&M, ODPhi prides itself on its diversity of mind and the diversity of its membership. Men of all socio-economic backgrounds, political ideologies, sexual orientations, races, and other self identifying factors have crossed over into the ranks of Delta Chapter and become part of the legacy. The fraternity's national motto \u201cOne culture, any race\u201d is not just a slogan; its something we take to heart and is the reason why as brothers we embrace each other unconditionally. \n\nODPhi has become an important driving force in the lives of all the men who have joined the ranks of our brotherhood.

Without that respect for honor, even more championships might be won, but they would be built on sand, fleeting, having been purchased at the expense of the integrity of the institution and its students.\n\nOne very significant and affordable way that each current or former student can contribute to Texas A&M Athletics is by demanding honor and integrity within the athletics program. The pressure to win has been a contributing factor in many athletic scandals, within and without NCAA athletics. In the past year, one historic football power has recently seen several of its recent accomplishments wiped from the record book and seen its potential to win in the future diminished because of cheating. The lesson is not, as some have suggested, \u201cdon\u2019t get caught,\u201d rather it is that such accomplishments could have been achieved without cheating. Cheating corrodes athletics, as it does everything it touches. Demand success, yes, but demand it be secured with integrity; otherwise, athletics becomes something that corrupts rather than builds character.\n\nIf you have any questions on this subject or have a topic you would like to see presented, please contact Athletic Compliance at compliance@athletics.tamu.edu or (979) 845-1904.\n\n", "name": "Texas A&M Compliance", "founded": "1876", "phone": "(979) 845-1904", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TAMUCompliance", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77843", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.342889086, "state": "TX", "street": "Texas A&M University, 1229 TAMU", "latitude": 30.6256669984}, "members": "Director of Athletic Compliance: David Batson\nAssistant Director of Compliance for Education: Brad Barnes\nAssistant Director of Compliance for Monitoring: Susan Tatum\nCompliance Coordinator: Catherine Harper\nCompliance Coordinator: ", "were_here_count": 0, "website": "www.aggieathletics.com www.twitter.com/TAMUCompliance", "checkins": 15, "id": "137023322997855", "is_published": true}

This is an umbrella organization under which more than 48 district committees and over 60 independently registered Gurung organizations are working actively in collaboration with like-minded organizations both within the country and abroad.\nThe birth of Tamu Hyula Chhonj Dhin Gurung Rastriya Parishad was the result of a resolution, the Chitwan Declaration 17 Chaitra 2065 BS (30 May 2009), this itself an outcome of the historic Tamu National Unification General Convention held in Chitwan from 15-17 Chaitra 2065 BS (28 to 30 May 2009 AD). It saw the merging of the two national level Gurung organizations, the Tamu Chhonj Dhin 2049 BS (1992 AD) and the Gurung (Tamu) Rastriya Parishad 2057 BS (2000 AD) into one entity to better serve the interests of Gurungs. Earlier, the relationship between the two was marked with lack of harmony interspersed with hostility at times. At this Convention both the organizations, burying their past hatchets, came to an understanding and realized the need and importance of a unified Tamu entity.

Also it will bring about awareness among the Tamu (Gurung) community of its importance. Since inception, the Association has been providing that awareness about the Tamu cultures and traditions with remarkable results. Tamu Pye Lhu Sangh is the only organization which has put much emphasis and efforts towards the heritage culture for practicing our culture based on the Pyeta\u00f1 Lhuta\u00f1.\n\n     In Religion categories: Pyeta\u00f1 Lhuta\u00f1 is the B\u00f6n religion; where nature and ancestors are worshipped and animism is practiced. The animism is the belief in a supernatural power that organizes and animates the materials of universe. The existence of animism has been supported by the anthropologists and more researches have been endorsed from all over the world. The Tamu (Gurung) are follower of the B\u00f6n religion; which is one of the oldest religions in the world using its own priest; Pachyu, Klhepree and B\u00f6npo Lam.\n\n     The efforts made by Tamu Pye Lhu Sangh is producing impressively positive results and effectively working to preserve our heritage cultures and to unite the Tamu (Gurung)s to their true identity. As this association represents the whole Tamu (Gurung)s; it is every single Tamu (Gurung)\u2019s responsibility to preserve the Pyeta\u00f1 Lhuta\u00f1, particularly  at this much need stage which is endangered by various influences.

In the studio projects, an emphasis is shared among the technical and expressive content of design work, the process by which students research, synthesize, and document their design ideas, and the creation of tangible products that achieve high quality of graphic and physical craft.\n\nThe studio courses are complemented by courses in technology, history, theory, and practice taught by renowned scholars in those fields to assure that students may design from a foundation of extensive and comprehensive knowledge of the built environment.\n\nComplementing the teaching program is an extensive program of inquiry in keeping with the norms of a research university. Faculty members engage in research, creative, and scholarly activities that enable maintenance of positions on the cutting edge of architectural knowledge. Students in the Master of Science in Architecture and the PhD in Architecture investigate open questions in the field and produce a thesis or dissertation that contributes to the body of knowledge of architecture.\n\nThe department is also committed to service to the people of Texas, the United States, and the world through engagement in projects of tangible and lasting value to communities.

Borlaug \u2014 by playing a key role in fighting world hunger.\n\nTo that end, the Borlaug Institute\u2019s primary work is planning and executing major agricultural and economic development projects inside developing countries across the globe. Each project aims to boost self-sufficiency in one or several agricultural disciplines while improving the economy of the country in which it is implemented. Together, these projects work to increase the world\u2019s food resources and food productivity at large.\n\nOur most highly venerated development project to date, the 2006-2012 Rwanda SPREAD project \u2014 SPREAD is an acronym for \u201cSustaining Partnerships to enhance Rural Enterprise and Agribusiness Development\u201d \u2014transformed Rwanda's agricultural economy most notably by using new planting practices to help native farmers produce high quality, specialty coffee beans that are now sold to major retailers like Starbucks. \n\nProjects like SPREAD, but with varying agricultural objectives, run concurrently in several countries at any given time \u2014 nations like South Sudan, Guatemala, Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nThe Borlaug Institute\u2019s staff coordinates development projects from headquarters at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. But it is university staff members \u2014 renowned Texas A&M professors and scientists \u2014 who travel into developing countries to make contact with native peoples and carry out our work at the ground level. And they don\u2019t do it alone.\n\nPartnerships\n\nWhile the Borlaug Institute serves as the leading, or primary, organization for most of the development projects we undertake \u2014 in some cases we assist other organizations \u2014 implementing each project requires myriad partnerships with governmental, academic and private organizations the world over. \n\nThe SPREAD project, for example, utilized partnerships with: the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID; the National University of Rwanda; The National Agricultural Export Development Board of Rwanda, or NAEB; the Specialty Coffee Association of America and a litany of private coffee bean buyers and roasters. Partnership systems for each of our ongoing development projects are equally complex and many partners work with The Borlaug Institute on several projects at once.  \n\nInternational Training \n\nIn addition to the work we do abroad, The Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture coordinates long- and short-term agricultural training programs in College Station for agriculture professionals from developing countries. Trainees include government leaders, university professors, scientists and students. Training takes place at the Texas A&M University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and is intended to impart the latest practices in a range of agricultural disciplines. International training provides a set of tools that trainees can take back to disseminate in their home countries \u2014 another way to promote global agricultural self-sufficiency. The Borlaug Institute\u2019s international training programs require many of the same partnerships as our development projects and are funded via many of the same sources. \n\nFunding\n\nThe Borlaug Institute\u2019s initiatives are funded through a range of sources, the largest of which is USAID, which accounts for about 52 percent of The Institute\u2019s $55 million portfolio. The U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Defense account for a combined 30 percent of funding while the U.S. Department of Agriculture, various private organizations and other nonprofit foundations comprise the remainder. The Borlaug Institute competes with like-minded organizations and universities for the funding and contracts that allow us to carry out the work we do around the world. \n\n", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash2/t1.0-9/s720x720/396976_10151318577128676_1927305020_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10151318577128676", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0}, "mission": "To employ agricultural science to feed the hungry, and to support, equity, economic growth, quality of life and mutual respect among peoples", "founded": "2006", "phone": "+1-979-845-4164", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/BorlaugTAMU", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77843-2477", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.3509332468, "state": "TX", "street": "578 John Kimbrough Blvd. Suite 201", "latitude": 30.6060176809}, "were_here_count": 37, "general_info": "Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture, Texas AgriLife Research, Texas A&M University System", "checkins": 37, "id": "30077973675", "website": "http://borlaug.tamu.edu/", "is_published": true}

CASiTA is a soulful artist and with her Mediterranean roots and a slightly raw edge to her voice she sparkles and creates a new international unique sound.  CASiTA is certainly not unfamiliar to the music industry; she\u2019s been all about music as long as she can remember and started performing and touring professionally at the age of 15. Because of that CASiTA was pointed out as a youth ambassador representing the Netherlands. CASiTA  was one of the female rappers and singers of a Hiphop format named the \u2018Outsidaz\u2019 \u2013 in collaboration with the legendary Herman Brood they released an album (1998) under the label OSM (outside music). Shortly after that CASiTA went solo. She toured in Europe and Africa and won a variety of awards such as Grote Prijs v Nederland - the best individual upcoming artist, the Essent Awards 2004 and many more.  Live performing is CASiTA true passion; she is truly a stage beast, entertaining and grabs your heart and attention with her vocals. She rocked a few international known major stages and festivals such as Lowlands, North Sea Jazz Festival, Made in Holland Royal Theatre Amsterdam Carr\u00e9, Friends for Warchild in Ahoy Rotterdam, Festival Mundial and many more.  She also has done the support act for a couple of great names in the Industry; Beyonc\u00e9, Delinquent Habits, Slum Village, Sugar Babes and many more. CASiTA was signed to a Major in the Netherlands in 2004, unfortunately it didn\u2019t work out as she expected, due to creative differences and future perspectives, she choice to move on and luckily she managed to get her strings cut lose so she could be herself and create the music her heart speaks and what she stands for.  After the deal CASiTA did one more successful theatre tour and planned to go back to NY where she\u2019s been going back and forth for the past few years. She had mapped out her plan to peruse her career in the United States, but exactly at that time she found out that her mother had cancer and needed help. CASiTA gave up on that dream and stayed to take care of her mother. CASiTA was there day in day out sleeping next to her mother at the hospital holding her hand until CASiTA\u2019s mother last breath of air. After CASiTA buried her mother she got homeless, burnout and sick. All that didn't stop CASiTA! She never been the same after that, but she promised her mother to keep on smiling and continue doing what she loved doing which is; MUSIC.  With a special Angel looking over CASiTA\u2019s shoulder, she\u2019s enjoying the journey. After all,  Life & success is a journey and not a destination! CASiTA is not only an artist but a young lady with a lot of experience under her belt, as a social & cultural entrepreneur she coached and helped a lot of youth from all walks of life. And she shares her experience, passion and love in her lyrics & music. CASiTA is definitely a rising Star!  CASiTA released her single \u2018TODAY\u2019 and it\u2019s out now on iTunes &  Spotify!

{"category": "Community", "website": "www.tamu-pyelhu.org", "can_post": true, "description": "[B]The Kohibo[/B]\n\nThe concept of the Kohibo design is the idea of Yarjung Kr\u00f5mchhai\u00f1 Tamu. He tried to reflect the distinctive nature of our identity into the design of the Kohibo. The idea was then further enchanced by Bhovar Palchai\u00f1 who spent many days and nights designing various models which became financially viable, spiritually meaningful and artistically impressive. The most architectually feasible one was finally designed by the Architect Engineer Lekh Bahadur Lehge Tamu. The financial management of the whole Kohibu construction budget was carefully managed by Honorary Major Hum Bahadur Lehge.\n[IMG]/images/articlephotos/kohibomodels.jpg[/IMG]\nThe Kohibo Shamans (pachyu, Klehpree, B\u00f6npo Lam) Monastery\n\nThe architectural design of the Kohibu(Holy Shrine) is based on the Pye Ta\u00f1 Lhu Ta\u00f1. On the top of the building, the crown is the Kleyh also known as Hy\u00f5 Kai\u00f1du, below is the Sargya Kai\u00f1du which stood as a single cone and the four large cones supporting the Kleh and Sargya, are the Chhyopa Kai\u00f1dus. These eccentric Kai\u00f1dus are highly regarded as they possess supreme abilities for protecting their followers. In the interior of the Kohibo; there are 9 pillars representing the Meku (9 planets), 8 of them are around the sides and one in the middle; each representing the planet of the solar system. The Mewa Parka Pye and So\u00f1ku Lo\u00f1ba (mystical voyage of the 9 Planets) are interestingly mentioned in the Pyeta\u00f1 Lhuta\u00f1. 3 Lhos on each side of the room. The total of the 12 Lhos are inscribed on the beam bar.\n\nFinally, the Kohibo, the holy shrine of the Tamu mai was completed with the generous assistance from many tamu mai which still stood with high pride as a symbol of the Tamu(Gurung). That has blessed all of us for prosperity and good health. For sure, the imminent threat of the external influences towards the Pyeta\u00f1 Lhuta\u00f1 has been diminished to the least but there is still a long way to go to complete this effort. We all should be pleased with the efforts so that our heritage culture can be found and followed. We should whole heartedly and delightfully declare that founder members of the Pyelhu Sangh should be regarded as the Legends of the Gurung which one hardly can contest on their contributions and dedications. It is another undisputed fact that these Legends names are written in the golden ink in the Tamu History.\n\nPrem Chahkli Tamu\nRaniswar, Majhakot-5, Syangja\n\nAt Present in London\n16 July 2006\n\nSources:\n1.

{"category": "Movie", "description": "Claudine is a 1974 American film, produced by Third World Films and distributed by 20th Century Fox. Starring James Earl Jones, Diahann Carroll, and Lawrence Hilton-Jacobs, it is noted for being one of the few mainstream films, featuring an African-American cast released during that time, which was not a blaxploitation film.Claudine was written by Lester Pine and Tina Pine and directed by John Berry. The film was released on April 22, 1974, grossing about $6 million.PlotThe film tells the story of Claudine Price , a single Black Harlem mother, living on welfare with six children, who finds love with a garbage collector, Rupert Marshall , whom she calls \"Roop\". The pair's relationship becomes complicated because of a number of factors. Among these are that the couple do not want to marry because they would not be able to support the children without welfare, and that the kids themselves, particularly eldest son Charles , are apprehensive of Rupert, and believe that he will leave their mother just like her previous husbands had.Claudine and Rupert meet while both of them are at work. Rupert asks Claudine out on a date with him and Claudine accepts. When Rupert becomes invited inside Claudine\u2019s apartment, the children are rude and vulgar towards Rupert. This is also the first time the audience meets the children and sees the inside of Claudine\u2019s slum-like apartment. Later on in the film, the audience finds out that Claudine receives financial aid from the government through the welfare program. Throughout the film, Miss Kabak, the social worker, visits Claudine at her home and asks her if she is employed and if she is dating anyone. Claudine always denies Miss Kabak the truth and lies to her about being unemployed and single. If Claudine tells the truth and says that she is employed, the amount of financial aid she receives from the welfare program would decrease or she could also no longer receive any more financial aid. If Claudine dates anyone and receives gifts from her boyfriend, the social worker has to deduct any money or gifts Claudine is receiving from whomever she is dating.", "talking_about_count": 131, "name": "Claudine", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Claudine/103111926396090", "likes": 32467, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "103111926396090", "is_published": true}

It is a summer month of 29 days, which occurs on the Gregorian calendar around June-July.The name of the month was adopted from the Assyrian-Babylonian calendar, in which the month was named after one of the main Mesopotamian gods, Tammuz. This is referred to in Ezekiel 8:14. Tammuz is also a month in the modern Assyrian calendar of the ethnic Assyrian Christians.Holidays in Tammuz17 Tammuz - Seventeenth of Tammuz \u2013 (Fast Day) 17 Tammuz is a fast day from 1 hour before sunrise to sundown in remembrance of Jerusalem's walls being breached. 17 Tammuz is the beginning of The Three Weeks, in which Jews follow similar customs as the ones followed during the Omer from the day following Passover until the culmination of the mourning for the death of the students of Rabbi Akiva (Akibah) the thirty-third day of the Omer - such as refraining from marriage and haircuts. The Three Weeks culminate with Tisha Be-Av (9th of Av). Ashkenazi communities refrain from wine and meat from the beginning of the month of Av, while Sefardi communities only do so from the beginning of the week in which the 9th of Av occurs. The mourning continues until noon on the 10th of Av, the date on which the Second Temple's destruction was complete.", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Tammuz (Hebrew month)", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Tammuz-Hebrew-month/1451252101760581", "likes": 1, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "1451252101760581", "is_published": true}

For 90 years, Texas A&M students\u2014known as Aggies\u2014built and burned a bonfire on campus each autumn. Known to the Aggie community simply as \"Bonfire\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \"burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u.\", a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas. The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual college football game.Early yearsThe students of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907 to congratulate the football team on a recent win. The first on-campus Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&M and the University of Texas, held near Thanksgiving Day. Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&M yearbook mentioned the \"final rally\" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event.", "category_list": [{"id": "209889829023118", "name": "Landmark"}], "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Aggie Bonfire", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Aggie-Bonfire/108210895873688", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.3350791874, "state": "TX", "street": "", "latitude": 30.6223582201}, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "checkins": 31, "id": "108210895873688", "is_published": true}

There are a variety of talks and activities designed to \"awaken\" the Holy Spirit within each of the retreaters. It concludes Sunday with the pinnacle of the Catholic Church, the celebration of the Mass.

Over 10 years ago I made the decision that even though I was making that multiple 6 figure income, I was not happy. I had a beautiful piece of property on Lake Conroe and a wonderful wife and I was never there to enjoy both. I had to find a way to stay home. Then I discovered personal development. \n\nNow I am a true student of personal development. I'm 64 years young and have been studying personal development for over 10 years. Someone might ask. There are people that have studied personal development their entire lives; what makes you more qualified than those people to provide me with direction? There are actually two reasons and you can decide for yourself.\n\nOne; not only have I been a student, but it is also my business. Our personal development products are unmatched by any other products. How do I know that? It's the results people, including myself have had in their lives. Now here is the key. Not only that, but by being with this company I surround myself by thousands of  like minded people and I'm part of weekly training calls and events. I'm always learning from other very successful entrepreneurs.\n\nTwo; I have experienced going from bankruptcy to where I am now; abundance in all areas of my life and most everything in between. I've been there, I've walked the walk and I'm able to always tell people what they deserve to hear, even though, it may not be necessarily what they want to hear.\n\nIt's a beautiful thing. I'm still on my journey of discovering myself and assisting people to wake-up and discover their magnificent selves. We are now living in Maui, HI.\n\nMichael Berry\nhttp://blog.prosperyourmind.com", "id": "180081892006992", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Public figure", "about": "This page was set up by a fan. Kim & Aggie do not manage this page in any way.", "can_post": true, "name": "Kim Woodburn & Aggie Mckenzie", "talking_about_count": 9, "personal_info": "Kim:\n\nKim Woodburn (born Patricia Mary MacKenzie on March 25, 1942 in Eastney, Hampshire, England) is an expert cleaner who appears on the British television programme How Clean Is Your House? and in 2007, starred in the Canadian series Kim's Rude Awakenings.\n\nEarly life:\nWoodburn was constantly beaten by her mother throughout her childhood and neglected by her father, who later attempted to molest her as a teenager. After fleeing from her home and moving from job to job, she became pregnant by her then boyfriend, who then left her. In February, 1966 she gave birth four months prematurely to a stillborn boy. Terrified of the stigma of being an unmarried mother and alone, she buried the baby's body in a nearby park. After this, she changed her name to Kim in an attempt to forget her past. She was also a victim of domestic violence by her first husband.\n\nCareer:\nWoodburn undertook many jobs in her adult life. She worked for a time as a social worker to teenage girls, in retail, and as a Littlewoods model in Liverpool in the late 1960s. In 1983, she made her first appearance on television on Pebble Mill at One, demonstrating knitwear. This was her only television appearance for the next 20 years, while she worked as a house cleaner in the UK and US. In 2002, she auditioned for Channel 4, while earning \u00a31000 a month as a cleaner. She was hired as a presenter of new show How Clean is Your House?, which began in February 2003. At the age of 61, Woodburn was catapulted into stardom as the show became an instant success. She has also filmed a version of the show in the US. In 2006 she wrote an autobiography, Unbeaten, which detailed her early life and was the first time she revealed the death of her baby. This revelation led to a police investigation, which she readily assisted with. In 2008, the sixth series of How Clean is Your House? was aired. She has also appeared in Panto with TV co-star Aggie MacKenzie.\n\nIn August 2009, Woodburn announced to Now Magazine that she was quitting How Clean is Your House? although this has not been confirmed.\n\nPersonal life:\nWoodburn has several half-sisters and half-brothers born to her mother and various men. Her mother died in 2000. Woodburn has married twice. Her first marriage to a policeman ended in divorce in the 1970s. She is currently married to Peter, also a former police officer and three years her junior. She owns two properties, one in Surrey, the other in Kent. She has no surviving children.\n\n\n\nAggie:\n\n\nMcKenzie was born in Rothiemurchus, Aviemore in the Cairngorms mountain region of the Scottish Highlands and went to school at Kingussie High School.[citation needed] It was here that she discovered her aptitude for languages. McKenzie attended Aberdeen College of Commerce where she attained a bilingual secretarial degree which earned her a job at the Foreign Office. After being security-screened and undergoing through background checks and interviews, she signed the Official Secrets Act and transferred from the Foreign Office to work with the Secret Intelligence Service, more commonly known as MI6, based in London. She worked in the organisation for a number of years and, even though she has now left, she is bound by the Official Secrets Act for life. She then took up a post at the National Union of Students Press Office. From here she moved to work at many women's magazines and then took the position of Associate Editor-in-Chief of the Good Housekeeping Magazine. Part of her responsibilities there was to review cleaning products and gadgets and write about household appliances as well as to create new recipes. She claims to have learned many of her domestic, cooking and cleaning skills from her mother who knew many remedies for removing stains.\n\nIt was this position with Good Housekeeping which led to her being asked to take a screen test for a new show that would become How Clean Is Your House?. McKenzie's screen test was successful and she was teamed up with professional cleaner Kim Woodburn in August 2002. McKenzie is known for giving a down to earth approach to cleaning with her Scottish, no nonsense voice, as she and Woodburn educate people on how to keep themselves and their houses clean, hygienic and tidy. The duo have produced books, games and DVDs due to the popularity of their shows. McKenzie has also appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in the US, where How Clean Is Your House? is airing on the BBC America.\n\nMcKenzie, who is now a multi-millionaire lives in Stoke Newington, Hackney, London, with her husband Matthew, and her two sons, Rory and Ewan.\n\nShe also appeared in the 2007/2008 (fourth) series of ITV's Dancing on Ice with her dance partner Sergey Malyshev.\n\nMcKenzie has labelled Wikipedia \"Stupedia\" for including unreferenced \"ridiculous rumours\" about her being offered multi-million pound television contracts.\n\n", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kim-Woodburn-Aggie-Mckenzie/137585978555", "likes": 1350, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "137585978555", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Organization", "description": "The Aggie Yell Leaders are a group of Texas A&M University student cheerleaders that lead Aggie fans in a series of \"yells\" during athletic events or other school events. The Yell Leaders are composed of five students (three seniors and two juniors) who are elected annually by popular vote of the student body.The Yell Leaders use a variety of hand signals, called \"pass-backs,\" to direct and intensify the crowds. One of the most notable former Aggie Yell Leaders is Texas Governor Rick Perry. Another notable former Aggie Yell Leader is Texas State Representative Trent Ashby.HistoryThe Yell Leader tradition dates to 1907. According to A&M lore, the Aggies were being soundly defeated and a large number of women who had taken the train from Texas Woman's University in Denton were threatening to leave. The upperclassmen ordered the freshmen to find a way to keep the women entertained. Several freshmen sneaked into a maintenance closet and changed into white coveralls. They then began leading the crowd in yells and telling jokes from the track in front of the stands. It was an instant hit and was quickly incorporated into the gameday repertoire for the Aggies. However, the freshmen became a little too popular with the ladies and \"it was decided that only upperclassmen would be allowed to participate in this entertainment in the future.\" While usually a position held by members of the Corps of Cadets, non-Corps students have been elected to the position. Ricky Wood, class of 2001, became the first non-corps Head Yell Leader in 2000-2001.In the early 1990s, the student body elected its first African American yell leader, Ronnie McDonald, Class of 1993. In 1999, McDonald became the youngest African American to become a county judge in the history of Texas. Arouna \"Boo Boo\" Davies Jr., Class of 2002, became the second African American yell leader.

Then, we sell them a simple, affordable house for the cost of the materials on a 30-year no-intrest loan. The houses are built using volunteer labor (that means you, yes you.)\n\nAlthough we are a Christian organization, we do not discriminate based on religion when choosing future homeowners and anyone is welcome join Habitat and to help build.", "founded": "1989", "likes": 816, "general_info": "Habitat for Humanity International was founded in 1976 by Linda and Millard Fuller. Habitat seeks to eliminate poverty housing and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. The Bryan/College Station Affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International was chartered in 1989 along with the Texas A&M Campus Chapter. Through the work of both affluent and needy people, Habitat builds new relationships and a sense of community as well as new housing through family nurturing, community education, and\nconstruction projects.\n\nThrough volunteer labor, management, expertise,\nand tax-deductible donations of money and materials, Habitat builds and repairs homes. Houses are sold at no profit to partner families, and no-interest mortgages are issued over a fixed period. Costs of homes differ relative to location, labor, land and materials. Homes in the Bryan/College Station Area cost about $59,500 on average.\n\nMonthly mortgage payments of approximately $375\nwith 0% interest, including taxes and insurance, are repaid over 20 to 30 years and deposited into a revolving \"Fund for Humanity\" which supports the construction of more houses. Habitat is not a giveaway program, but is a joint venture in which those who benefit from the housing ministry are involved in the work at various levels. Each homeowner family is required to invest 400-500 hours of \"sweat equity\" into the construction of their home. 100 of these hours can be donated from friends and family of the homeowners.\n\nThis reduces the cost of the house, fosters pride of\nownership among family members, and lays the foundation for the development of positive relationships with other people. Aggie Habitat for Humanity is the Campus Chapter of Habitat for Humanity International at Texas A&M University. A&M students, former students, faculty, and staff are invited and encouraged to volunteer and work on any Aggie Habitat project.

Now our football team back in 1907 wasn't quite as good as they are today, in fact it had been about 3 years since they had won a single football game and the Aggies were getting tired of being outscored. Well the juniors and seniors couldn't have that so they got 5 freshmen to run onto Kyle field and provide a little entertainment. On their way down to the field they stopped by a janitors closet and borrowed 5 white janitor's ducts similar to the ones we wear today and then they ran down onto the field and lead a few yells. The fans loved it! So the position quickly got changed to 3 seniors and 2 juniors which it still is today. Now the job of an Aggie Yell Leader is to promote and perpetuate Aggie athletics and tradition and we do this by attending all home and away football games, men's and women's basketball, women's soccer, volleyball, Fish Camps, New Student Conferences, Aggie Mom's clubs and many other thing that the University deems neccessary. Its a very busy job but great to give back to the University that we all love so much. That's the tradition of Yell Leader and how we got started.

The 2nd annual Stride for Aggie Pride 5K will take place on May 18th, 2014. The course will take the participants through the UC Davis campus going through the notable arboretum and other campus features along the way. The event is open to participants of all ages. \n\nThis event aims to promote a healthy lifestyle, with a specific focus on student holistic health to promote being mentally and physically fit. Various local businesses from the Davis community as well as the region have united to show support for the cause and will be featured throughout the event at booths and hands-on activities.\n\nAll proceeds from the 5K Aggie Stride for Pride benefit the ASUCD Endowment Fund and We Are Aggie Pride. The ASUCD Scholarship was created in 1999 and funds student scholarships through the ASUCD Scholarship.

{"category": "Musician/band", "bio": "Dj aGGie Cardozo\n\n\nMusic is one Of thing He can't stay without it. He use to love music since when He was 10 years old. At the age of 16 He started going to the clubs & some of the House partys with friends. we can say that it was the Biggest turning point of His life, from that time He started listening to electronic music & He found it so interesting that at the age of 17  He thought of dj'ing & He went in to it. I can say proudly that He Has never learned deejaying or asked for Help from any of source, cause He says that music is within His soul\u201d....\n\n\naGGie specializes in House music & one of those EDM Artist, & His Performances alongside National & International DJ\u2019s Association & Collaboration, Over the years Dj aGGie Has Shared The Console With some of the Best Dj\u2019s LIKE Sabrina Terence (UAE), Nikhil Chinapa (SUBMERGE), DJ AJIT PAI (GOA), Dj Angel (BOMBAY), DJ Donnaa (KOLKATA) DJ NICK TESS (GOA), and Has played at Clubs like Club Magarita, Club Westend, Club Poison. There's still a long way to go in the club circuit. He's just 25 years old and He believes he is still learning something new everytime He Hears an international Dj on a podcast. \"I want to keep learning new skills and tricks. The possibilities are vast but you Have to be on your toes and keep learning and trying something new\" He says...\n\n\nFavorite artist: Armin van Buuren, Ti\u00ebsto, Ferry Corsten, David Guetta, Afrojack, Fedde Le Grand, Gareth Emery, Avicii, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, Chuckie, Hardwell, Above and Beyond.\n\n\nList upcoming shows: @ CLUB TITO'S n lots of freelancing events everyday.\n\n\nThis young artist Has conquered Huge crowds entertaining them at Taj Exotica, Taj Vivanta, Goa Marriott, Leela\u2019s, Zuri, Radisson white sand, Park Hyatt, Radisson Blu Resort, Kenilworth, Cidade de Goa, Riviera de Goa, Holiday Inn, Hotel Ramada and Intercontinental Goa just to name a few...\n\n\nAn artist who lives Music and most of all with a deep passion, which makes the overall experience worthwhile...\n\nNever loose an opportunity to Hear Dj aGGie work his spell at any party for he will usually captivate your body mind and senses !!!", "about": "For Bookings / Enquirers, Contact : +91 9923446704 / Resident DJ for Club Tito's South Goa.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dj-aggie-cardozo", "talking_about_count": 14, "description": "\u2605 \u266a \u266b \u266a |\u0332\u0305\u0305\u25cf\u0332\u0305\u0305|\u0332\u0305\u0305=\u0332\u0305\u0305|\u0332\u0305\u0305\u25cf\u0332\u0305\u0305| \u266a \u266b \u266a \u2605\n\nTOP 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY TO A DJ !!!\n\n\nATTENTION DJs: REPOST\n\nBefore requesting songs, making comments, or asking questions to the DJ please\u2026 CHECK BELOW FOR YOUR REQUEST:\n\n1. PLAY SOMETHING GOOD\u2026SOMETHING WE CAN DANCE TO !!!\nThe DJ Has To play for more than one person\u2026 so, What you may Hate may be another's favorite song and EVERYTHING played Here can Be danced to one way or another.\n\n2. WOULD YOU PLAY SOMETHING WITH A BEAT?\nBE SERIOUS! We Know of NO songs played in a Club That Don't Have some sort of a Beat !!!\n\n3. I DON'T KNOW WHO SINGS IT AND I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG, BUT IT GOES LIKE THIS\u2026\nPlease Don't sing for The DJ !!! They Have to put up with smoke-filled rooms and dangerous decibel levels all night. Do them a favor and DON'T give them a rendition of your favorite song !!!\n\n4. EVERYBODY WANTS TO HEAR IT !!\nOh sure, you polled EVERYONE in the Club and, as their spokesperson, you are requesting the song.\n\n5. I CAN GET LAID IF YOU PLAY IT!\nIf you are GOOD ENOUGH, you can get laid to anything !! (also been known as \"buy the album and get laid for a month!\"). If you need ME to play you a song so that YOU can get laid, you've got problems. \n\n6. I WANT TO HEAR IT NEXT!\nThe only people who can get away with that statement write the DJ's paycheck! Plus more often than not, the DJ Has the next song already cued up and ready to go, and does not Have time to find your song, get it on the decks, and get it cued up in Time to Be Next !!\n\n7. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANNA HEAR\u2026 WHAT DO YOU HAVE ???\nIt's a lot easier for you To go Have another beer and figure out what you want to hear than it is for the DJ to recite the name of EVERY record in the booth! Also don't ask for a songlist! I don't know of any Club DJ's that actually keep a printed list with them! We keep it in our Heads or sometimes in a database !!!\n\n8. HEY YO, NOBODY CAN DANCE TO THIS !!!\nIt is not advisable to say this when the dance floor is packed (but, some people do anyway) !! However, even if there is only ONE person on the floor, it STILL contradicts the statement. You're just being rude. Have an open mind about music\n\n9. EVERYBODY WILL DANCE TO IT IF YOU PLAY IT!\nHalf the time I Hear This, no-one goes to the dancefloor except for the person that asked for it, and when they realize they're the only one that wanted to dance to it, they bail. If you ask the DJ for a dance song and don't dance to it, expect the DJ to ignore your requests the rest of the night. However, if we play your song and you dance and have a good time, even if no-one else does, we'll still take your next request seriously. We like to please, even if it's one person at a time.\n\n10. MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!! If you're at a Club or event that doesn't play any Hiphop, don't ask if \"you got any Hiphop\"? Just go outside to your car and Turn on the radio or go Home and watch MTV !!!!!!!\n\n\nSOME EXTRA ASSORTED THINGS NOT TO SAY\n\nIf you ask for a song and the DJ says \"I just played it\", DON'T SAY, \"Well, I just got Here.\" It makes absolutely no difference. None at all. If you want To Be sure you Hear your favorite song at the Club, you better Be There when the DJ starts his/her set. We don't Have a flashing red light in the Booth That Tells us that you're There and we can play your song now.\n\nDON'T SAY, \"Is this the only kind of music you play?\" If you go to a Chinese restaurant, you wouldn't ask for Italian food. Rock Clubs play rock, alternative Clubs play alternative, discos play disco, etc., etc., etc\u2026\n\n If you ask for a song, BE SPECIFIC. DON'T SAY, \"I wanna Hear something, anything but Not this !! \" Try going to the Bar and saying, \" I wanna drink something, anything but Not this\u2026 \" You can't complain if you're not SPECIFIC. HOWEVER, if you ARE specific and the DJ says they don't Have the song, DON'T SAY, \" What the **** !! What do you mean you don't Have it? What kind of DJ are you? Why don't you get into the wonderful world of fast food !!! You obviously don't know what you're doing as a DJ !!!* We may reply with \"I don't come to your job and SMACK the DICK out of your mouth when your working. \" THE DJ MAY SHOOT YOU!!! OR DROP KICK YOUR ASS MATRIX STYLE! Or just Have you escorted out of the club. We can do that. Trust me. DO NOT BE AN ASS.\n\n Special Note\n\nA nightclub DJ gets very little respect. They are expected to play everything for everybody. It is impossible to satisfy all to the people all of the time, yet Club jocks are expected to do just that. If a radio jock tells His listeners a song is a Hit, the majority of the people think it must be \"Because they said so on the radio.\" However, 80% of the time that same song was Being played in a Club long Before the radio \"DISCOVERED\" the \"NEW\" song. So give the DJ a break! The next time you request a song, stop and think Before you speak. Remember a request is just that\u2026 a request!! It's not a guarantee your song will get played!! Ask once for your song and the DJ will try and play it. Keep asking and you're Being a pain in the ass! Don't send all your friends to request the same song Hoping to get it played. DJ's aren't that stupid !!! They get dozens of requests in a night and there isn't enough time to play them all.\n\nIf you Have a CD that you want the DJ to play, and the DJ agrees to listen to it, they're ALREADY DOING YOU A FAVOR BY TAKING THE TIME TO DO SO. If they don't play it don't be pissed, they made a judgment call that the music wasn't the right type to be played. If you wanna Hear only songs that you wanna Hear, STAY AT HOME AND LISTEN TO YOUR CD'S.\n\n If you DJ or MC (or just say that you do) DON'T ask me if you can \"DJ/MC for a little bit\" AT MY GIG especially if I don't know you ! If you wanna spin/MC at a Club, talk to the owners and give them a mix tape! No one will take you serious without one. Of course unless you already Have paying gigs (in which case you wouldn't be trying to do it at my gig). They're paying us to play music and make announcements, not to Host open mic night.\n\nMy booth is not a \"Coat Check!\" So don't come up in it asking me, if I could watch your coat/purse. If that shit is to much for you to Handle you should have left it in your Damn car!!!\n\nAlso don't come up in the DJ booth and just Hover around!!!! A DJ needs space to work. You don't see me coming into your work and standing over your computer, or looking over your shoulder while your trying to work. That would just be plain Fucking rude !!!!!\n\nAnd if I do decide to let you Hang around in the both, NEVER EVER set your BEER/Drink down around my VERY EXPENSIVE equipment!!!!! If that spills I'm out Thousands of Rupees !!!!! You don't see me and my folks Hanging out on the Hood of your car. So PLEASE Show me the same respect for something important to me.\n\nAnd above all and most Importantly, if The DJ Has One Hand On The Mixer, One Hand on a VINYL and is wearing Headphones, DON'T BUG US unless you know us !!!!!!!\n\nHES MIXING !!!!!!\n\nOh, I almost forgot one more thing. Don't flash us any money for your request unless your \"DONALD TRUMP\" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIt's a Hard job Being a DJ. Our work most of the time goes very much unappreciated. Think about it, we are the only people in the Club who don't get a Chance to actually just sit and Hang out with our buddies. If we stop to take a break, the whole Club and the music stops with us. We spend sometimes 6 to 8 hours in a booth, STANDING the whole time. We are lucky, if we get a Chance to find a second to take a Bathroom Break. Cause when we screw up and the music Stops everyone starts yelling and complaining. \"No one ever remembers when we are doing a good job, but screw up even once, and everyone notices\"\n\nIf you Read This and appreciate it\u2026 Show Some Love to the DJ. Post a comment. Buy their mixtapes. Go see them perform. Tell a friend about them. Buy them a drink. Tip them. Treat them well.... !!!", "press_contact": "agnelocardozo7@gmail.com", "hometown": "Margao - Goa", "booking_agent": "+91 9923446704 +919850768573", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1238718_590359751000730_737367902_n.jpg", "cover_id": "590359751000730", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 7}, "name": "Dj aGGie Cardozo", "website": "http://facebook.com/Djaggie, http://twitter.com/#!/aggiecardozo, http://www.myfavdj.in/profiles/view/7837, http://soundcloud.com/dj-aggie-cardozo", "artists_we_like": "Armin van Buuren, David Guetta, Ti\u00ebsto, Afrojack, Hardwell, Chuckie, Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Above and Beyond.", "likes": 1077, "current_location": "Goa", "genre": "RnB, Hip Hop, Commercial, House, Dutch House, Progressive House, Retro Etc.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dj-aGGie-Cardozo/241574352545940", "were_here_count": 0, "id": "241574352545940", "is_published": true}

After losing the first two games of their football season in 1922, the freshman class marched around Kyle Field together, led by a piccolo player and a brass horn to the tune of a mournful funeral march, trying to break the \"curse\" of the team. When they became seniors three years later, they decided to take one final walk around the campus together, this time to remember their time spent in Aggieland and the friends and memories they had made. As they walked single file, each man with his hand on the shoulder of his friend before him, an observer noted that they \"looked like elephants, about to die.\" Thus the tradition of Elephant Walk was born. In subsequent years, it became a tradition reserved for seniors that takes place each year before the last football game of the season, traditionally the night that Bonfire would burn.\n\nAs the years progressed, Elephant Walk became a much-anticipated celebration. Unfortunately, it also became a time for the junior class to sabotage the seniors. Elephant Walk, through the 1980's and early 1990's was marked as a sloppy display of ill-will and competition between the classes. Injuries frequently resulted as well. This was disgracing our campus and almost ruined the tradition. In 1993, the first Jr. E-Walk gave the juniors an alternative and a new tradition was born. The juniors have their own walk and speaker now and participate with the senior class in the games, pictures with elephants, food and other festivities.\n\nElephant Walk and Jr. E-Walk are important to this university. They unify classes of thousands of diverse students. The Elephant Walk line has been known to stretch a mile as 3,000 seniors sprawl across campus. Sales from merchandise with the logos of these events usually earn the junior and senior classes about $20,000 that goes to the purchase of a class gift after graduation.", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/s720x720/988320_460734357378089_633125266_n.jpg", "cover_id": "460734357378089", "offset_x": 50, "offset_y": 0}, "name": "Elephant Walk and Jr. E-Walk", "website": "http://elephantwalk.tamu.edu/node/1", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/AggieElephantWalk", "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "", "zip": "77843", "country": "United States"}, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "187277854723742", "is_published": true}

We do not directly place our dogs, but donate them to nationally recognized organizations upon completion of their phase 1 training where they complete their phase two training and are placed with their forever partner. We primarily train mobility assistance and PTSD dogs.  \n\n ", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/s720x720/1463557_254270184722052_19520501_n.jpg", "cover_id": "254270184722052", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 64}, "website": "http://ags.tamu.edu/", "name": "Aggie Guide Dogs and Service Dogs", "founded": "Texas A&M's orginial service dog training organization, founded in 1997", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/aggieguidedogsandservicedogs", "likes": 224, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "253781768104227", "is_published": true}

But the similarities end there.\n \nAward winning and critically acclaimed photographic artist, the Rio Grande Sun, June 19, 2008 said of Aggie\u2019s work. \n\n\"Photographic artist, Aggie Villanueva's, photographic treatment of her subjects sometimes begins to border on the surreal. Villanueva is one of those rare individuals who uses new technology, such as Adobe Photoshop to, to take a digital image to a new and exciting level. With some photographers this digitizing and manipulation are evident and stumbling\u2026not so with Villanueva's work, which is sophisticated and well thought out. She has a knack for transferring her impression of a scene to the viewer that is remarkable and almost magical.\" \n\nAggie describes her beloved mountains: \u201cRural subjects in the Southwest are very different than elsewhere in the United States. We are the last true American frontier; with a gritty purity born of living close to the land. The American Southwest continually draws awe and interest worldwide, as well as from our own sea to shining sea.\u201d\n\nAnd Aggie should know. Beginning in 1996 she lived in rural New Mexico\u2019s Madrid/Cerillos area without electricity, phone or plumbing, and hauling all her water.

{"category": "Musician/band", "description": "The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band is the official marching band of Texas A&M University. Composed of over 400 men and women from the school's Corps of Cadets, it is the largest military marching band in the world. The band's complex straight-line marching maneuvers are performed exclusively to traditional marches.Since its inception in 1894, its members eat together, sleep in the same dormitories, and practice up to forty hours per week on top of a full academic schedule. The Aggie Band performs at all home football games, some away games, and university and Corps functions throughout the year. The band has also participated in inauguration parades for many United States Presidents and Texas Governors, major annual parades across the country, and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library.HistoryEarly yearsThe Aggie Band owes its existence to Joseph Holick. In 1885, Holick and his brother Louis boarded an empty boxcar bound for Orange, Texas so that they could gain employment in a lumber mill. En route, the two stopped in Bryan, Texas, near the campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. The 22-year-old Holick began to doubt his choice, stating, \"I was a small boy and couldn't do lumbering work\", and chose to remain in Bryan working under Raymond Blatherwick, owner of a prominent boot shop. Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the president of the nearby college and a former Governor of Texas, stopped into Blatherwick's boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to Bryan for their boots. Ross requested Holick be stationed at the new military college to perform cobbler duties.", "talking_about_count": 23, "name": "Fightin' Texas Aggie Band", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fightin-Texas-Aggie-Band/105492029484019", "likes": 4274, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "105492029484019", "is_published": true}

It is an unauthorized replica, rendered by Edward L. A. Pausch, of Augustus St. Gaudens' allegorical figure, popularly called Grief, at the Adams Memorial in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. The statue is of a seated figure in a cowl or shroud.Beginning with its installation in 1926, the statue was surrounded by many urban legends, principally that someone spending a night in its lap would be haunted by the ghosts of those buried there; that the spirits of individuals buried at Druid Ridge would annually convene at the statue; that no grass would grow on the ground where the statue's shadow would lay during the daytime; or that the statue would animate itself during the night, whether by physically moving or by showing glowing red eyes.These urban legends led to much unwelcome attention toward the statue; many people were caught breaking into the cemetery at night to visit it, and the pedestal was frequently vandalized. The Agnus family, disturbed by the attention the statue received, donated it to the Smithsonian in 1967. It sat for many years in storage at the National Museum of American Art (later named the Smithsonian American Art Museum) where an authorized recasting of the original Adams Memorial statue now sits.", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Black Aggie", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Black-Aggie/133018446735753", "likes": 111, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "133018446735753", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Interest", "description": "Penny and Aggie is a webcomic written by T Campbell and drawn by Jason Waltrip, centered on the two eponymous high school girls, Penny Levac and Aggie d'Amour. Penny is a blonde, over-confident and somewhat arrogant teen queen, who is on top of the social circles in school, and Aggie is an eccentric outcast who takes pride in her rebelliousness. Before May 2009 it was drawn by Gis\u00e8le Lagac\u00e9.The comic focuses mainly around the relationships between the characters. In particular, the uneasy relationship between the two protagonists, whose differences in outlook often leads to clashes between them.Penny and Aggie, depicted as a rich materialistic but charming girl and a middle-class free-spirited though self-righteous girl, sometimes draw comparisons to Veronica Lodge and Betty Cooper of Archie Comics fame. However, Penny and Aggie are distinguished from the classic Archie Comics love-interests by the fact that narrative events in the Penny and Aggie world have concrete effects on the characters (as opposed to the eternal stasis of the narrative world in Betty and Veronica Magazine), and the fact that there is no common love interest that Penny and Aggie share (thus preventing the Penny and Aggie narrative from succumbing to the Betty and Veronica syndrome).", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Penny and Aggie", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Penny-and-Aggie/109508639080949", "likes": 151, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "109508639080949", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Musician/band", "description": "The California Aggie Marching Band-uh! is the official University of California, Davis marching band. The band, which has roughly 250 members, plays at both home and away games to cheer on the UC Davis Aggies sports teams, as well as participating in parades.The original UC Davis marching band dates back to 1922, when E. H. Barger of the school's veterinary science department formed an 18-member group. That band disbanded after interest waned.The current incarnation of the band was formed in 1929, when the university was approximately 20 years old, as a pep band for the home football games. There were 15 original members, all male. The first female members joined within two years. In the 1960s, the student body voted to exclude women from the Band-uh!, allegedly to give the band a rowdier, more masculine spirit. During the women's rights movement in the early 1970s, pressure mounted to reopen the band to women, in part to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By 1973, the Band-uh! once again had female members.The Band-uh! has been occasionally associated with controversial and obscene antics. It was reprimanded several times in the 1970's. In 1992 the band was put on probation after a sexual harassment charge was made against the student director. In 2008, the staff director of the band, who is not a student, filed a sexual harassment complaint to the university after several incidents involving the removal of shirts, offensive language and gestures, and lewd behavior. In October, 2008, he left temporarily on a \"leave of absence because of all the band stress.\"", "talking_about_count": 8, "name": "UC Davis California Aggie Marching Band-uh!", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/UC-Davis-California-Aggie-Marching-Band-uh/112932955387671", "likes": 469, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "112932955387671", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Tv show", "description": "How Clean Is Your House? was a British entertainment/lifestyle television programme in which expert cleaners Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie visited extremely filthy homes and then cleaned them to perfection. The thirty-minute show was produced by Talkback Thames, the UK production arm of FremantleMedia (itself part of the RTL Group), and airs on Channel 4 and many of its subsidiary channels. It was first broadcast in 2003 and was an immediate ratings success. In November 2009, Channel 4 announced that they had decided to cancel the series in order to make way for new programming.SummaryEach episode of the programme follows the same formula. The viewers are first briefly introduced to the residents of the home to be cleaned. Then, accompanied by a dramatic score of horror movie music, Kim and Aggie explore the abode on their own, examining the extent of the mess and looking for any particularly horrible areas. Kim and Aggie then meet the resident before the cleaning begins, assisted by several professional cleaners. During this process, which takes up the bulk of the show, Kim and Aggie share tips for tackling particular cleaning tasks with the residents (and the viewers), often relying on traditional methods rather than expensive commercial cleaning products.During the cleaning, Aggie takes swab samples from the filthiest areas of the house and has them analysed in a lab, often revealing numerous kinds of bacteria, frequently E. coli or salmonella. Often residents of the home have health problems that directly stem from the air quality or pathogens present before cleaning; Aggie will show these residents her findings in an effort to make them understand the connection between their health and their home's condition.

{"category": "Organization", "description": "The California Aggie is a weekly newspaper distributed in the Davis, California area. It is staffed entirely by UC Davis students and is the official campus newspaper.HistoryThe California Aggie was first published in 1915 as the Weekly Agricola after its approval by the Associated Student Executive Committee. At this point, UC Davis was considered the University Farm, an extension of UC Berkeley. Students from UC Berkeley's paper, The Daily Californian, advised the Weekly Agricola during its beginning months.Initially, the Weekly Agricola was focused on both student news and farming-related topics. Novelist Jack London was one of the first readers of the Weekly Agricola. In 1922, it was renamed to match the school's athletic name.Today, the Aggie has the largest print distribution in Yolo County, at around 8,000 copies distributed daily. It is available for free at many stands around the UC Davis campus.The Aggie ceased production of their Friday issues in February 2009,, moved to a weekly format in 2013 to reduce operating costs, and is going online-only while its pending fee is being determined as of March, 2014.Managing staffThe Aggie managing staff for the 2013-2014 academic year is:Editor in Chief - Elizabeth OrpinaManaging Editor - Claire TanNew Media Manager- Brian NguyenCampus Editor - Scott DresserCity Editor - Paayal ZaveriOpinion Editor - Tanya AzariFeatures Editor - Naomi NishiharaSports Editor - Kenneth Ling", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "The California Aggie", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-California-Aggie/109618869065171", "likes": 97, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "109618869065171", "is_published": true}

SEAL, or Seniors Experiencing Aggie Life, is held in November and is geared towards high-school seniors. SEAL conference allows these seniors to get a closer look at Aggieland as they apply to universities of their choice. Whoopin' Weekend is held in late February or early March, and is geared towards high school sophomores, juniors and seniors. The Whoopin' Weekend Conference gives all high school students an in-depth look at Aggieland as they either prepare to begin the application process to college, or as they prepare to make a decision on attending Texas A&M University. \n\nARC also takes time out of the holiday break to recruit at high schools around our members' hometowns, reaching as far as the Midwest and New England. Our members bring information for potential freshman along with their unique student-perspective to interested high school students, providing them with valuable advice on admissions, financial aid, housing, scholarships. \n\n ARC is also heavily involved in the Bryan/College Station area and on campus at Texas A&M University. ARC participates in many service activities, such as Big Event, Relay for Life, along with local fun runs for charitable organizations.\n \n\n", "id": "211423592247405", "is_published": true}

The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual college football game.Early yearsThe students of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907 to congratulate the football team on a recent win. The first on-campus Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&M and the University of Texas, held near Thanksgiving Day. Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&M yearbook mentioned the \"final rally\" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire.

By implementing this through extensive staff preparation, team building, service projects, and leadership development -- culminating in a three-day retreat -- it is believed that all members will enhance and progress in their own spiritual growth, thereby inspiring Christ in others.\n\nAggie Awakening is a Catholic retreat designed for college-age students from Texas A&M University and Blinn College. It is held three times a year -- once in the Fall, Spring, and Summer semesters. \n \nAwakening is a three-day retreat beginning around 3:00 pm on a Friday and concluding around 5:00 pm on Sunday. There are a variety of talks and activities designed to \"awaken\" the Holy Spirit within each of the retreaters. It concludes Sunday with the pinnacle of the Catholic Church, the celebration of the Mass. All college students, regardless of religion, are invited to attend.\n\nIf you would like further information on this retreat, please contact a member of leadership listed on Awakening Leadership page, or call St. Mary's Catholic Center at (979) 846-5717.", "checkins": 102, "id": "136892946341456", "is_published": true}

Over 10 years ago I made the decision that even though I was making that multiple 6 figure income, I was not happy. I had a beautiful piece of property on Lake Conroe and a wonderful wife and I was never there to enjoy both. I had to find a way to stay home. Then I discovered personal development. \n\nNow I am a true student of personal development. I'm 64 years young and have been studying personal development for over 10 years. Someone might ask. There are people that have studied personal development their entire lives; what makes you more qualified than those people to provide me with direction? There are actually two reasons and you can decide for yourself.\n\nOne; not only have I been a student, but it is also my business. Our personal development products are unmatched by any other products. How do I know that? It's the results people, including myself have had in their lives. Now here is the key. Not only that, but by being with this company I surround myself by thousands of  like minded people and I'm part of weekly training calls and events. I'm always learning from other very successful entrepreneurs.\n\nTwo; I have experienced going from bankruptcy to where I am now; abundance in all areas of my life and most everything in between. I've been there, I've walked the walk and I'm able to always tell people what they deserve to hear, even though, it may not be necessarily what they want to hear.\n\nIt's a beautiful thing. I'm still on my journey of discovering myself and assisting people to wake-up and discover their magnificent selves.

{"category": "Public figure", "about": "This page was set up by a fan. Kim & Aggie do not manage this page in any way.", "can_post": true, "name": "Kim Woodburn & Aggie Mckenzie", "talking_about_count": 9, "personal_info": "Kim:\n\nKim Woodburn (born Patricia Mary MacKenzie on March 25, 1942 in Eastney, Hampshire, England) is an expert cleaner who appears on the British television programme How Clean Is Your House? and in 2007, starred in the Canadian series Kim's Rude Awakenings.\n\nEarly life:\nWoodburn was constantly beaten by her mother throughout her childhood and neglected by her father, who later attempted to molest her as a teenager. After fleeing from her home and moving from job to job, she became pregnant by her then boyfriend, who then left her. In February, 1966 she gave birth four months prematurely to a stillborn boy. Terrified of the stigma of being an unmarried mother and alone, she buried the baby's body in a nearby park. After this, she changed her name to Kim in an attempt to forget her past. She was also a victim of domestic violence by her first husband.\n\nCareer:\nWoodburn undertook many jobs in her adult life. She worked for a time as a social worker to teenage girls, in retail, and as a Littlewoods model in Liverpool in the late 1960s. In 1983, she made her first appearance on television on Pebble Mill at One, demonstrating knitwear. This was her only television appearance for the next 20 years, while she worked as a house cleaner in the UK and US. In 2002, she auditioned for Channel 4, while earning \u00a31000 a month as a cleaner. She was hired as a presenter of new show How Clean is Your House?, which began in February 2003. At the age of 61, Woodburn was catapulted into stardom as the show became an instant success. She has also filmed a version of the show in the US. In 2006 she wrote an autobiography, Unbeaten, which detailed her early life and was the first time she revealed the death of her baby. This revelation led to a police investigation, which she readily assisted with. In 2008, the sixth series of How Clean is Your House? was aired. She has also appeared in Panto with TV co-star Aggie MacKenzie.\n\nIn August 2009, Woodburn announced to Now Magazine that she was quitting How Clean is Your House? although this has not been confirmed.\n\nPersonal life:\nWoodburn has several half-sisters and half-brothers born to her mother and various men. Her mother died in 2000. Woodburn has married twice. Her first marriage to a policeman ended in divorce in the 1970s. She is currently married to Peter, also a former police officer and three years her junior. She owns two properties, one in Surrey, the other in Kent. She has no surviving children.\n\n\n\nAggie:\n\n\nMcKenzie was born in Rothiemurchus, Aviemore in the Cairngorms mountain region of the Scottish Highlands and went to school at Kingussie High School.[citation needed] It was here that she discovered her aptitude for languages. McKenzie attended Aberdeen College of Commerce where she attained a bilingual secretarial degree which earned her a job at the Foreign Office. After being security-screened and undergoing through background checks and interviews, she signed the Official Secrets Act and transferred from the Foreign Office to work with the Secret Intelligence Service, more commonly known as MI6, based in London. She worked in the organisation for a number of years and, even though she has now left, she is bound by the Official Secrets Act for life. She then took up a post at the National Union of Students Press Office. From here she moved to work at many women's magazines and then took the position of Associate Editor-in-Chief of the Good Housekeeping Magazine. Part of her responsibilities there was to review cleaning products and gadgets and write about household appliances as well as to create new recipes. She claims to have learned many of her domestic, cooking and cleaning skills from her mother who knew many remedies for removing stains.\n\nIt was this position with Good Housekeeping which led to her being asked to take a screen test for a new show that would become How Clean Is Your House?. McKenzie's screen test was successful and she was teamed up with professional cleaner Kim Woodburn in August 2002. McKenzie is known for giving a down to earth approach to cleaning with her Scottish, no nonsense voice, as she and Woodburn educate people on how to keep themselves and their houses clean, hygienic and tidy. The duo have produced books, games and DVDs due to the popularity of their shows. McKenzie has also appeared on the Oprah Winfrey show in the US, where How Clean Is Your House? is airing on the BBC America.\n\nMcKenzie, who is now a multi-millionaire lives in Stoke Newington, Hackney, London, with her husband Matthew, and her two sons, Rory and Ewan.\n\nShe also appeared in the 2007/2008 (fourth) series of ITV's Dancing on Ice with her dance partner Sergey Malyshev.\n\nMcKenzie has labelled Wikipedia \"Stupedia\" for including unreferenced \"ridiculous rumours\" about her being offered multi-million pound television contracts.\n\n", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Kim-Woodburn-Aggie-Mckenzie/137585978555", "likes": 1350, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "137585978555", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Organization", "description": "The Aggie Yell Leaders are a group of Texas A&M University student cheerleaders that lead Aggie fans in a series of \"yells\" during athletic events or other school events. The Yell Leaders are composed of five students (three seniors and two juniors) who are elected annually by popular vote of the student body.The Yell Leaders use a variety of hand signals, called \"pass-backs,\" to direct and intensify the crowds. One of the most notable former Aggie Yell Leaders is Texas Governor Rick Perry. Another notable former Aggie Yell Leader is Texas State Representative Trent Ashby.HistoryThe Yell Leader tradition dates to 1907. According to A&M lore, the Aggies were being soundly defeated and a large number of women who had taken the train from Texas Woman's University in Denton were threatening to leave. The upperclassmen ordered the freshmen to find a way to keep the women entertained. Several freshmen sneaked into a maintenance closet and changed into white coveralls. They then began leading the crowd in yells and telling jokes from the track in front of the stands. It was an instant hit and was quickly incorporated into the gameday repertoire for the Aggies. However, the freshmen became a little too popular with the ladies and \"it was decided that only upperclassmen would be allowed to participate in this entertainment in the future.\" While usually a position held by members of the Corps of Cadets, non-Corps students have been elected to the position. Ricky Wood, class of 2001, became the first non-corps Head Yell Leader in 2000-2001.In the early 1990s, the student body elected its first African American yell leader, Ronnie McDonald, Class of 1993. In 1999, McDonald became the youngest African American to become a county judge in the history of Texas. Arouna \"Boo Boo\" Davies Jr., Class of 2002, became the second African American yell leader.

Habitat seeks to eliminate poverty housing and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. The Bryan/College Station Affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International was chartered in 1989 along with the Texas A&M Campus Chapter. Through the work of both affluent and needy people, Habitat builds new relationships and a sense of community as well as new housing through family nurturing, community education, and\nconstruction projects.\n\nThrough volunteer labor, management, expertise,\nand tax-deductible donations of money and materials, Habitat builds and repairs homes. Houses are sold at no profit to partner families, and no-interest mortgages are issued over a fixed period. Costs of homes differ relative to location, labor, land and materials. Homes in the Bryan/College Station Area cost about $59,500 on average.\n\nMonthly mortgage payments of approximately $375\nwith 0% interest, including taxes and insurance, are repaid over 20 to 30 years and deposited into a revolving \"Fund for Humanity\" which supports the construction of more houses. Habitat is not a giveaway program, but is a joint venture in which those who benefit from the housing ministry are involved in the work at various levels. Each homeowner family is required to invest 400-500 hours of \"sweat equity\" into the construction of their home. 100 of these hours can be donated from friends and family of the homeowners.\n\nThis reduces the cost of the house, fosters pride of\nownership among family members, and lays the foundation for the development of positive relationships with other people. Aggie Habitat for Humanity is the Campus Chapter of Habitat for Humanity International at Texas A&M University. A&M students, former students, faculty, and staff are invited and encouraged to volunteer and work on any Aggie Habitat project.

Now our football team back in 1907 wasn't quite as good as they are today, in fact it had been about 3 years since they had won a single football game and the Aggies were getting tired of being outscored. Well the juniors and seniors couldn't have that so they got 5 freshmen to run onto Kyle field and provide a little entertainment. On their way down to the field they stopped by a janitors closet and borrowed 5 white janitor's ducts similar to the ones we wear today and then they ran down onto the field and lead a few yells. The fans loved it! So the position quickly got changed to 3 seniors and 2 juniors which it still is today. Now the job of an Aggie Yell Leader is to promote and perpetuate Aggie athletics and tradition and we do this by attending all home and away football games, men's and women's basketball, women's soccer, volleyball, Fish Camps, New Student Conferences, Aggie Mom's clubs and many other thing that the University deems neccessary. Its a very busy job but great to give back to the University that we all love so much. That's the tradition of Yell Leader and how we got started.

At the age of 16 He started going to the clubs & some of the House partys with friends. we can say that it was the Biggest turning point of His life, from that time He started listening to electronic music & He found it so interesting that at the age of 17  He thought of dj'ing & He went in to it. I can say proudly that He Has never learned deejaying or asked for Help from any of source, cause He says that music is within His soul\u201d....\n\n\naGGie specializes in House music & one of those EDM Artist, & His Performances alongside National & International DJ\u2019s Association & Collaboration, Over the years Dj aGGie Has Shared The Console With some of the Best Dj\u2019s LIKE Sabrina Terence (UAE), Nikhil Chinapa (SUBMERGE), DJ AJIT PAI (GOA), Dj Angel (BOMBAY), DJ Donnaa (KOLKATA) DJ NICK TESS (GOA), and Has played at Clubs like Club Magarita, Club Westend, Club Poison. There's still a long way to go in the club circuit. He's just 25 years old and He believes he is still learning something new everytime He Hears an international Dj on a podcast. \"I want to keep learning new skills and tricks. The possibilities are vast but you Have to be on your toes and keep learning and trying something new\" He says...\n\n\nFavorite artist: Armin van Buuren, Ti\u00ebsto, Ferry Corsten, David Guetta, Afrojack, Fedde Le Grand, Gareth Emery, Avicii, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, Chuckie, Hardwell, Above and Beyond.\n\n\nList upcoming shows: @ CLUB TITO'S n lots of freelancing events everyday.\n\n\nThis young artist Has conquered Huge crowds entertaining them at Taj Exotica, Taj Vivanta, Goa Marriott, Leela\u2019s, Zuri, Radisson white sand, Park Hyatt, Radisson Blu Resort, Kenilworth, Cidade de Goa, Riviera de Goa, Holiday Inn, Hotel Ramada and Intercontinental Goa just to name a few...\n\n\nAn artist who lives Music and most of all with a deep passion, which makes the overall experience worthwhile...\n\nNever loose an opportunity to Hear Dj aGGie work his spell at any party for he will usually captivate your body mind and senses !!!", "about": "For Bookings / Enquirers, Contact : +91 9923446704 / Resident DJ for Club Tito's South Goa.\nhttps://soundcloud.com/dj-aggie-cardozo", "talking_about_count": 14, "description": "\u2605 \u266a \u266b \u266a |\u0332\u0305\u0305\u25cf\u0332\u0305\u0305|\u0332\u0305\u0305=\u0332\u0305\u0305|\u0332\u0305\u0305\u25cf\u0332\u0305\u0305| \u266a \u266b \u266a \u2605\n\nTOP 10 THINGS YOU SHOULD NEVER SAY TO A DJ !!!\n\n\nATTENTION DJs: REPOST\n\nBefore requesting songs, making comments, or asking questions to the DJ please\u2026 CHECK BELOW FOR YOUR REQUEST:\n\n1. PLAY SOMETHING GOOD\u2026SOMETHING WE CAN DANCE TO !!!\nThe DJ Has To play for more than one person\u2026 so, What you may Hate may be another's favorite song and EVERYTHING played Here can Be danced to one way or another.\n\n2. WOULD YOU PLAY SOMETHING WITH A BEAT?\nBE SERIOUS! We Know of NO songs played in a Club That Don't Have some sort of a Beat !!!\n\n3. I DON'T KNOW WHO SINGS IT AND I DON'T KNOW THE NAME OF THE SONG, BUT IT GOES LIKE THIS\u2026\nPlease Don't sing for The DJ !!! They Have to put up with smoke-filled rooms and dangerous decibel levels all night. Do them a favor and DON'T give them a rendition of your favorite song !!!\n\n4. EVERYBODY WANTS TO HEAR IT !!\nOh sure, you polled EVERYONE in the Club and, as their spokesperson, you are requesting the song.\n\n5. I CAN GET LAID IF YOU PLAY IT!\nIf you are GOOD ENOUGH, you can get laid to anything !! (also been known as \"buy the album and get laid for a month!\"). If you need ME to play you a song so that YOU can get laid, you've got problems. \n\n6. I WANT TO HEAR IT NEXT!\nThe only people who can get away with that statement write the DJ's paycheck! Plus more often than not, the DJ Has the next song already cued up and ready to go, and does not Have time to find your song, get it on the decks, and get it cued up in Time to Be Next !!\n\n7. I DON'T KNOW WHAT I WANNA HEAR\u2026 WHAT DO YOU HAVE ???\nIt's a lot easier for you To go Have another beer and figure out what you want to hear than it is for the DJ to recite the name of EVERY record in the booth! Also don't ask for a songlist! I don't know of any Club DJ's that actually keep a printed list with them! We keep it in our Heads or sometimes in a database !!!\n\n8. HEY YO, NOBODY CAN DANCE TO THIS !!!\nIt is not advisable to say this when the dance floor is packed (but, some people do anyway) !! However, even if there is only ONE person on the floor, it STILL contradicts the statement. You're just being rude. Have an open mind about music\n\n9. EVERYBODY WILL DANCE TO IT IF YOU PLAY IT!\nHalf the time I Hear This, no-one goes to the dancefloor except for the person that asked for it, and when they realize they're the only one that wanted to dance to it, they bail. If you ask the DJ for a dance song and don't dance to it, expect the DJ to ignore your requests the rest of the night. However, if we play your song and you dance and have a good time, even if no-one else does, we'll still take your next request seriously. We like to please, even if it's one person at a time.\n\n10. MOST IMPORTANTLY!!!! If you're at a Club or event that doesn't play any Hiphop, don't ask if \"you got any Hiphop\"? Just go outside to your car and Turn on the radio or go Home and watch MTV !!!!!!!\n\n\nSOME EXTRA ASSORTED THINGS NOT TO SAY\n\nIf you ask for a song and the DJ says \"I just played it\", DON'T SAY, \"Well, I just got Here.\" It makes absolutely no difference. None at all. If you want To Be sure you Hear your favorite song at the Club, you better Be There when the DJ starts his/her set. We don't Have a flashing red light in the Booth That Tells us that you're There and we can play your song now.\n\nDON'T SAY, \"Is this the only kind of music you play?\" If you go to a Chinese restaurant, you wouldn't ask for Italian food. Rock Clubs play rock, alternative Clubs play alternative, discos play disco, etc., etc., etc\u2026\n\n If you ask for a song, BE SPECIFIC. DON'T SAY, \"I wanna Hear something, anything but Not this !! \" Try going to the Bar and saying, \" I wanna drink something, anything but Not this\u2026 \" You can't complain if you're not SPECIFIC. HOWEVER, if you ARE specific and the DJ says they don't Have the song, DON'T SAY, \" What the **** !! What do you mean you don't Have it? What kind of DJ are you? Why don't you get into the wonderful world of fast food !!! You obviously don't know what you're doing as a DJ !!!* We may reply with \"I don't come to your job and SMACK the DICK out of your mouth when your working. \" THE DJ MAY SHOOT YOU!!! OR DROP KICK YOUR ASS MATRIX STYLE! Or just Have you escorted out of the club. We can do that. Trust me. DO NOT BE AN ASS.\n\n Special Note\n\nA nightclub DJ gets very little respect. They are expected to play everything for everybody. It is impossible to satisfy all to the people all of the time, yet Club jocks are expected to do just that. If a radio jock tells His listeners a song is a Hit, the majority of the people think it must be \"Because they said so on the radio.\" However, 80% of the time that same song was Being played in a Club long Before the radio \"DISCOVERED\" the \"NEW\" song. So give the DJ a break! The next time you request a song, stop and think Before you speak. Remember a request is just that\u2026 a request!! It's not a guarantee your song will get played!! Ask once for your song and the DJ will try and play it. Keep asking and you're Being a pain in the ass! Don't send all your friends to request the same song Hoping to get it played. DJ's aren't that stupid !!! They get dozens of requests in a night and there isn't enough time to play them all.\n\nIf you Have a CD that you want the DJ to play, and the DJ agrees to listen to it, they're ALREADY DOING YOU A FAVOR BY TAKING THE TIME TO DO SO. If they don't play it don't be pissed, they made a judgment call that the music wasn't the right type to be played. If you wanna Hear only songs that you wanna Hear, STAY AT HOME AND LISTEN TO YOUR CD'S.\n\n If you DJ or MC (or just say that you do) DON'T ask me if you can \"DJ/MC for a little bit\" AT MY GIG especially if I don't know you ! If you wanna spin/MC at a Club, talk to the owners and give them a mix tape! No one will take you serious without one. Of course unless you already Have paying gigs (in which case you wouldn't be trying to do it at my gig). They're paying us to play music and make announcements, not to Host open mic night.\n\nMy booth is not a \"Coat Check!\" So don't come up in it asking me, if I could watch your coat/purse. If that shit is to much for you to Handle you should have left it in your Damn car!!!\n\nAlso don't come up in the DJ booth and just Hover around!!!! A DJ needs space to work. You don't see me coming into your work and standing over your computer, or looking over your shoulder while your trying to work. That would just be plain Fucking rude !!!!!\n\nAnd if I do decide to let you Hang around in the both, NEVER EVER set your BEER/Drink down around my VERY EXPENSIVE equipment!!!!! If that spills I'm out Thousands of Rupees !!!!! You don't see me and my folks Hanging out on the Hood of your car. So PLEASE Show me the same respect for something important to me.\n\nAnd above all and most Importantly, if The DJ Has One Hand On The Mixer, One Hand on a VINYL and is wearing Headphones, DON'T BUG US unless you know us !!!!!!!\n\nHES MIXING !!!!!!\n\nOh, I almost forgot one more thing. Don't flash us any money for your request unless your \"DONALD TRUMP\" !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\n\nIt's a Hard job Being a DJ. Our work most of the time goes very much unappreciated. Think about it, we are the only people in the Club who don't get a Chance to actually just sit and Hang out with our buddies. If we stop to take a break, the whole Club and the music stops with us. We spend sometimes 6 to 8 hours in a booth, STANDING the whole time. We are lucky, if we get a Chance to find a second to take a Bathroom Break. Cause when we screw up and the music Stops everyone starts yelling and complaining. \"No one ever remembers when we are doing a good job, but screw up even once, and everyone notices\"\n\nIf you Read This and appreciate it\u2026 Show Some Love to the DJ. Post a comment. Buy their mixtapes. Go see them perform. Tell a friend about them. Buy them a drink. Tip them. Treat them well.... !!!", "press_contact": "agnelocardozo7@gmail.com", "hometown": "Margao - Goa", "booking_agent": "+91 9923446704 +919850768573", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1238718_590359751000730_737367902_n.jpg", "cover_id": "590359751000730", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 7}, "name": "Dj aGGie Cardozo", "website": "http://facebook.com/Djaggie, http://twitter.com/#!/aggiecardozo, http://www.myfavdj.in/profiles/view/7837, http://soundcloud.com/dj-aggie-cardozo", "artists_we_like": "Armin van Buuren, David Guetta, Ti\u00ebsto, Afrojack, Hardwell, Chuckie, Avicii, Swedish House Mafia, Above and Beyond.", "likes": 1077, "current_location": "Goa", "genre": "RnB, Hip Hop, Commercial, House, Dutch House, Progressive House, Retro Etc.", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Dj-aGGie-Cardozo/241574352545940", "were_here_count": 0, "id": "241574352545940", "is_published": true}

After losing the first two games of their football season in 1922, the freshman class marched around Kyle Field together, led by a piccolo player and a brass horn to the tune of a mournful funeral march, trying to break the \"curse\" of the team. When they became seniors three years later, they decided to take one final walk around the campus together, this time to remember their time spent in Aggieland and the friends and memories they had made. As they walked single file, each man with his hand on the shoulder of his friend before him, an observer noted that they \"looked like elephants, about to die.\" Thus the tradition of Elephant Walk was born. In subsequent years, it became a tradition reserved for seniors that takes place each year before the last football game of the season, traditionally the night that Bonfire would burn.\n\nAs the years progressed, Elephant Walk became a much-anticipated celebration. Unfortunately, it also became a time for the junior class to sabotage the seniors. Elephant Walk, through the 1980's and early 1990's was marked as a sloppy display of ill-will and competition between the classes. Injuries frequently resulted as well. This was disgracing our campus and almost ruined the tradition. In 1993, the first Jr. E-Walk gave the juniors an alternative and a new tradition was born. The juniors have their own walk and speaker now and participate with the senior class in the games, pictures with elephants, food and other festivities.\n\nElephant Walk and Jr. E-Walk are important to this university. They unify classes of thousands of diverse students. The Elephant Walk line has been known to stretch a mile as 3,000 seniors sprawl across campus. Sales from merchandise with the logos of these events usually earn the junior and senior classes about $20,000 that goes to the purchase of a class gift after graduation.", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/s720x720/988320_460734357378089_633125266_n.jpg", "cover_id": "460734357378089", "offset_x": 50, "offset_y": 0}, "name": "Elephant Walk and Jr. E-Walk", "website": "http://elephantwalk.tamu.edu/node/1", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/AggieElephantWalk", "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "", "zip": "77843", "country": "United States"}, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "187277854723742", "is_published": true}

We do not directly place our dogs, but donate them to nationally recognized organizations upon completion of their phase 1 training where they complete their phase two training and are placed with their forever partner. We primarily train mobility assistance and PTSD dogs.  \n\n ", "can_post": true, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/s720x720/1463557_254270184722052_19520501_n.jpg", "cover_id": "254270184722052", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 64}, "website": "http://ags.tamu.edu/", "name": "Aggie Guide Dogs and Service Dogs", "founded": "Texas A&M's orginial service dog training organization, founded in 1997", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/aggieguidedogsandservicedogs", "likes": 224, "were_here_count": 0, "id": "253781768104227", "is_published": true}

But the similarities end there.\n \nAward winning and critically acclaimed photographic artist, the Rio Grande Sun, June 19, 2008 said of Aggie\u2019s work. \n\n\"Photographic artist, Aggie Villanueva's, photographic treatment of her subjects sometimes begins to border on the surreal. Villanueva is one of those rare individuals who uses new technology, such as Adobe Photoshop to, to take a digital image to a new and exciting level. With some photographers this digitizing and manipulation are evident and stumbling\u2026not so with Villanueva's work, which is sophisticated and well thought out. She has a knack for transferring her impression of a scene to the viewer that is remarkable and almost magical.\" \n\nAggie describes her beloved mountains: \u201cRural subjects in the Southwest are very different than elsewhere in the United States. We are the last true American frontier; with a gritty purity born of living close to the land. The American Southwest continually draws awe and interest worldwide, as well as from our own sea to shining sea.\u201d\n\nAnd Aggie should know. Beginning in 1996 she lived in rural New Mexico\u2019s Madrid/Cerillos area without electricity, phone or plumbing, and hauling all her water.

{"category": "Musician/band", "description": "The Fightin' Texas Aggie Band is the official marching band of Texas A&M University. Composed of over 400 men and women from the school's Corps of Cadets, it is the largest military marching band in the world. The band's complex straight-line marching maneuvers are performed exclusively to traditional marches.Since its inception in 1894, its members eat together, sleep in the same dormitories, and practice up to forty hours per week on top of a full academic schedule. The Aggie Band performs at all home football games, some away games, and university and Corps functions throughout the year. The band has also participated in inauguration parades for many United States Presidents and Texas Governors, major annual parades across the country, and the dedication ceremony for the George H. W. Bush Presidential Library.HistoryEarly yearsThe Aggie Band owes its existence to Joseph Holick. In 1885, Holick and his brother Louis boarded an empty boxcar bound for Orange, Texas so that they could gain employment in a lumber mill. En route, the two stopped in Bryan, Texas, near the campus of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas. The 22-year-old Holick began to doubt his choice, stating, \"I was a small boy and couldn't do lumbering work\", and chose to remain in Bryan working under Raymond Blatherwick, owner of a prominent boot shop. Lawrence Sullivan Ross, the president of the nearby college and a former Governor of Texas, stopped into Blatherwick's boot shop and noted how inconvenient it was for cadets to go to Bryan for their boots. Ross requested Holick be stationed at the new military college to perform cobbler duties.", "talking_about_count": 23, "name": "Fightin' Texas Aggie Band", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Fightin-Texas-Aggie-Band/105492029484019", "likes": 4274, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "105492029484019", "is_published": true}

It is an unauthorized replica, rendered by Edward L. A. Pausch, of Augustus St. Gaudens' allegorical figure, popularly called Grief, at the Adams Memorial in Rock Creek Cemetery in Washington, D.C. The statue is of a seated figure in a cowl or shroud.Beginning with its installation in 1926, the statue was surrounded by many urban legends, principally that someone spending a night in its lap would be haunted by the ghosts of those buried there; that the spirits of individuals buried at Druid Ridge would annually convene at the statue; that no grass would grow on the ground where the statue's shadow would lay during the daytime; or that the statue would animate itself during the night, whether by physically moving or by showing glowing red eyes.These urban legends led to much unwelcome attention toward the statue; many people were caught breaking into the cemetery at night to visit it, and the pedestal was frequently vandalized. The Agnus family, disturbed by the attention the statue received, donated it to the Smithsonian in 1967. It sat for many years in storage at the National Museum of American Art (later named the Smithsonian American Art Museum) where an authorized recasting of the original Adams Memorial statue now sits.", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Black Aggie", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Black-Aggie/133018446735753", "likes": 111, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "133018446735753", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Interest", "description": "Penny and Aggie is a webcomic written by T Campbell and drawn by Jason Waltrip, centered on the two eponymous high school girls, Penny Levac and Aggie d'Amour. Penny is a blonde, over-confident and somewhat arrogant teen queen, who is on top of the social circles in school, and Aggie is an eccentric outcast who takes pride in her rebelliousness. Before May 2009 it was drawn by Gis\u00e8le Lagac\u00e9.The comic focuses mainly around the relationships between the characters. In particular, the uneasy relationship between the two protagonists, whose differences in outlook often leads to clashes between them.Penny and Aggie, depicted as a rich materialistic but charming girl and a middle-class free-spirited though self-righteous girl, sometimes draw comparisons to Veronica Lodge and Betty Cooper of Archie Comics fame. However, Penny and Aggie are distinguished from the classic Archie Comics love-interests by the fact that narrative events in the Penny and Aggie world have concrete effects on the characters (as opposed to the eternal stasis of the narrative world in Betty and Veronica Magazine), and the fact that there is no common love interest that Penny and Aggie share (thus preventing the Penny and Aggie narrative from succumbing to the Betty and Veronica syndrome).", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "Penny and Aggie", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Penny-and-Aggie/109508639080949", "likes": 151, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "109508639080949", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Musician/band", "description": "The California Aggie Marching Band-uh! is the official University of California, Davis marching band. The band, which has roughly 250 members, plays at both home and away games to cheer on the UC Davis Aggies sports teams, as well as participating in parades.The original UC Davis marching band dates back to 1922, when E. H. Barger of the school's veterinary science department formed an 18-member group. That band disbanded after interest waned.The current incarnation of the band was formed in 1929, when the university was approximately 20 years old, as a pep band for the home football games. There were 15 original members, all male. The first female members joined within two years. In the 1960s, the student body voted to exclude women from the Band-uh!, allegedly to give the band a rowdier, more masculine spirit. During the women's rights movement in the early 1970s, pressure mounted to reopen the band to women, in part to comply with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. By 1973, the Band-uh! once again had female members.The Band-uh! has been occasionally associated with controversial and obscene antics. It was reprimanded several times in the 1970's. In 1992 the band was put on probation after a sexual harassment charge was made against the student director. In 2008, the staff director of the band, who is not a student, filed a sexual harassment complaint to the university after several incidents involving the removal of shirts, offensive language and gestures, and lewd behavior. In October, 2008, he left temporarily on a \"leave of absence because of all the band stress.\"", "talking_about_count": 8, "name": "UC Davis California Aggie Marching Band-uh!", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/UC-Davis-California-Aggie-Marching-Band-uh/112932955387671", "likes": 469, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "112932955387671", "is_published": true}

{"category": "Tv show", "description": "How Clean Is Your House? was a British entertainment/lifestyle television programme in which expert cleaners Kim Woodburn and Aggie MacKenzie visited extremely filthy homes and then cleaned them to perfection. The thirty-minute show was produced by Talkback Thames, the UK production arm of FremantleMedia (itself part of the RTL Group), and airs on Channel 4 and many of its subsidiary channels. It was first broadcast in 2003 and was an immediate ratings success. In November 2009, Channel 4 announced that they had decided to cancel the series in order to make way for new programming.SummaryEach episode of the programme follows the same formula. The viewers are first briefly introduced to the residents of the home to be cleaned. Then, accompanied by a dramatic score of horror movie music, Kim and Aggie explore the abode on their own, examining the extent of the mess and looking for any particularly horrible areas. Kim and Aggie then meet the resident before the cleaning begins, assisted by several professional cleaners. During this process, which takes up the bulk of the show, Kim and Aggie share tips for tackling particular cleaning tasks with the residents (and the viewers), often relying on traditional methods rather than expensive commercial cleaning products.During the cleaning, Aggie takes swab samples from the filthiest areas of the house and has them analysed in a lab, often revealing numerous kinds of bacteria, frequently E. coli or salmonella. Often residents of the home have health problems that directly stem from the air quality or pathogens present before cleaning; Aggie will show these residents her findings in an effort to make them understand the connection between their health and their home's condition.

{"category": "Organization", "description": "The California Aggie is a weekly newspaper distributed in the Davis, California area. It is staffed entirely by UC Davis students and is the official campus newspaper.HistoryThe California Aggie was first published in 1915 as the Weekly Agricola after its approval by the Associated Student Executive Committee. At this point, UC Davis was considered the University Farm, an extension of UC Berkeley. Students from UC Berkeley's paper, The Daily Californian, advised the Weekly Agricola during its beginning months.Initially, the Weekly Agricola was focused on both student news and farming-related topics. Novelist Jack London was one of the first readers of the Weekly Agricola. In 1922, it was renamed to match the school's athletic name.Today, the Aggie has the largest print distribution in Yolo County, at around 8,000 copies distributed daily. It is available for free at many stands around the UC Davis campus.The Aggie ceased production of their Friday issues in February 2009,, moved to a weekly format in 2013 to reduce operating costs, and is going online-only while its pending fee is being determined as of March, 2014.Managing staffThe Aggie managing staff for the 2013-2014 academic year is:Editor in Chief - Elizabeth OrpinaManaging Editor - Claire TanNew Media Manager- Brian NguyenCampus Editor - Scott DresserCity Editor - Paayal ZaveriOpinion Editor - Tanya AzariFeatures Editor - Naomi NishiharaSports Editor - Kenneth Ling", "talking_about_count": 0, "name": "The California Aggie", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-California-Aggie/109618869065171", "likes": 97, "were_here_count": 0, "is_community_page": true, "id": "109618869065171", "is_published": true}

SEAL, or Seniors Experiencing Aggie Life, is held in November and is geared towards high-school seniors. SEAL conference allows these seniors to get a closer look at Aggieland as they apply to universities of their choice. Whoopin' Weekend is held in late February or early March, and is geared towards high school sophomores, juniors and seniors. The Whoopin' Weekend Conference gives all high school students an in-depth look at Aggieland as they either prepare to begin the application process to college, or as they prepare to make a decision on attending Texas A&M University. \n\nARC also takes time out of the holiday break to recruit at high schools around our members' hometowns, reaching as far as the Midwest and New England. Our members bring information for potential freshman along with their unique student-perspective to interested high school students, providing them with valuable advice on admissions, financial aid, housing, scholarships. \n\n ARC is also heavily involved in the Bryan/College Station area and on campus at Texas A&M University. ARC participates in many service activities, such as Big Event, Relay for Life, along with local fun runs for charitable organizations.\n \n\n", "id": "211423592247405", "is_published": true}
