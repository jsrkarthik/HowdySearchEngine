", "can_post": true, "description": "OFFICIAL 2014 SPONSORS:\n\nCraig Enderlin\nJody Fry\nBowdark Consulting\nLee Sullivan \nCantrell Bryan\nDrew Wasikowski\nRyan Haines\n\nThe Texas A&M Quidditch Team was founded in the fall of 2008 by avid Quidditch enthusiasts Aimee Howarth, Kristen Howarth, and Elizabeth Witt. The organization began with only two house teams and Sunday practices and has grown to have four house teams and weekly practices for those committed to playing on the intercollegiate level. \n\nWe have two levels of play offered to members: intramural and intercollegiate. Intramural play refers to the sunday house matches which are generally relaxed and less competitive. Intercollegiate play requires extra weekly practices which are currently set up on Monday, Wednesday and Thursday. These practices are designed to improve players' skills, agility, strength, and endurance, so they can compete in competitive matches against other colleges and represent the organization on a national front. \n\nThe organization also holds social events (i.e. House lunches, Team dinners, and Yule Ball) and participates in volunteer work (i.e. Big Event and Glow Run). \n\n**Practice Times**\nSunday- 3pm Simpson Drill Field\nMonday, Wednesday and Thursday- 6:30 Penberthy Lighted Fields\n\n\n**New Member Info**\nWe accept new members year round as long as they sign a waiver and pay dues. Any member is welcome to come out to intercollegiate practices, but play in tournaments and against other colleges is decided by the coach. \n\nNew members do not need any experience. We can teach you everything you need to know, but do be prepared to invest in the following items if you plan on playing competitively...\n    -Broom\n    -Bandanas\n    -Cleats\n    -Gloves\n    -Team jersey\n    -Bandaids and icy hot (No joke this sport is very rough!)\n\n\n\nIf you have any questions or need to contact us for any reason email us at:\n\nquid@quidditch.tamu.edu\n\n\n\n\n", "talking_about_count": 40, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1958202_671373992925076_30397415_n.jpg", "cover_id": "671373992925076", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 70}, "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "", "zip": "", "country": "United States"}, "website": "http://quidditch.tamu.edu     ", "affiliation": "Texas A&M", "awards": "2014 Southwest Regional Champions\n\nBoth teams qualified for World Cup VII\n\n2014 Diamond  Cup - 1st Place\n2013 Lone Star Cup - 1st Place\n2013 Wolfpack Classic - 1st Place\n\n", "likes": 1634, "members": "Officer Information\n\nPresident:  Rosemary Ross (email:  rosemaryross@tamu.edu)\nDirector of Operations & Treasurer:  Bailey Murphy\nPR & IT:  Maddie Franklin\nIntramural Coordinator:  Sam Keegan Adlis\nHead Coach:  Drew Wasikowski\nAssistant Coaches:  Becca DuPont, Rachel Harrison & Kifer Gregoire\n", "were_here_count": 0, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/texasamquidditch", "is_published": true, "id": "155828851146262", "name": "Texas A&M Quidditch"}

Here students embark on a journey of self-discovery. They learn how to unlock their creative potential, become lifelong learners, intellectual leaders and knowledge creators.\n\nThe college is literally abuzz with creativity around the clock as its 1,900 students, 140 faculty and 59 professional staff engage in myriad design and multimedia projects focused on the transformation of the human environment. Space is in constant motion as students collaborate and concepts take form in sketches, paintings, computer simulations, models, photographs, sculptures and video.\n\nArchitectural installations and artwork are regularly erected, studied and deconstructed. The walls are papered with an ever-changing mosaic of project posters that are pinned up, rigorously reviewed, and taken down to make room for next review.\n\nWhile some students study alone in private nooks, computer labs or the college\u2019s reference library, others collaborate in studios, classrooms or the coffee shop. There are lectures, seminars, workshops, design charrettes, exhibits, concerts, film screenings, celebrations and special events \u2014 many planned and many impromptu.\n\nA cacophony of busy power tools and sophisticated machinery echoes from the college\u2019s woodshop where architectural models, furniture, artwork and special projects take shape. On the nearby prairie, the whirl and hum of a CNC router and plasma cutter denote more substantial structures in the works at the college\u2019s 12-acre Digital Fabrication Facility, referred to affectionately by students as the \u201cArchitecture Ranch.\u201d\n \nBecause the creativity and empathy with which each discipline is practiced has a profound influence on the quality of life in society, College of Architecture students are challenged to weave aesthetics, safety, function, financial feasibility, sustainability and environmental stewardship into the creative process.\n\nRecognizing that no single professional track or narrow specialization can adequately prepare tomorrow\u2019s building, design, planning and visualization professionals, the college is distinctive in offering a truly interdisciplinary curriculum. As one of the largest schools of its kind, housing all of the built environment disciplines, the college is uniquely suited to facilitate interdisciplinary collaboration and research.\n\nIts rich and diverse research portfolio includes projects conducted in its four academic departments, through its multiple institutes, research centers and specialized laboratories, and in collaboration with other colleges and centers within the university and around the world. The college\u2019s Institute for Applied Creativity and five formally organized research centers \u2014 the CRS Center for Leadership and Management in the Design and Construction Industry, the Center for Housing and Urban Development, the Hazard Reduction and Recovery Center, the Center for Health Systems & Design, and the Center for Heritage Conservation \u2014 expand the public knowledge base of the industries and professions they serve while supporting specialized graduate certificate programs.\n\nAnd because we all live in a highly interconnected world, those pursuing an undergraduate degree at the college are required to spend a long semester away from Texas A&M University\u2019s College Station campus, either engaged in a professional internship or studying abroad in one of the college\u2019s well-established programs in Italy, Spain, Germany, the United Kingdom or elsewhere.", "talking_about_count": 16, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-prn2/t1.0-9/s720x720/1506904_10152253596825420_44185916_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10152253596825420", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 50}, "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "3137 TAMU", "zip": "77843-3137", "country": "United States"}, "website": "http://one.arch.tamu.edu/", "phone": "(979) 845-1222", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/TAMU.architecture", "likes": 4474, "were_here_count": 0, "is_published": true, "id": "11950375419", "name": "Texas A&M University College of Architecture"}

Created in 1950 in response to the needs of the Texas Highway Department, TTI has since broadened its focus to address all modes of transportation\u2014highway, air, water, rail and pipeline. TTI is a state agency and a member of The Texas A&M University System.\n\nTTI pioneered the \"breakaway\" and the \"crash cushion\" concepts.\nThe cooperative relationship with the Texas Department of Transportation (TxDOT), formalized by the Texas legislature in 1949, has been key to the success and real-world applicability of the TTI program.

In 1976, horticulture and floricultural activities were removed from the Soil and Crop Sciences Department and placed into a separate Department of Horticultural Sciences.Our mission has always been closely interwoven with that of the Morril Act, which provided for the creation of land-grant universities. Signed into law by President Abraham Lincoln on July 2, 1862, the act established colleges that would teach military tactics as well as engineering and agriculture. The Hatch Act of 1887 established the Agricultural Experiment Station component, outreach function through the Cooperative Extension Service. Together the Morrill, Hatch, and Smith-Lever Acts formalized the three-part mission of all land-grant universities, education, research and extension.\n\nAgriculture produces food, feed, fiber, bioenergy, green space, and other products and benefits through the systematic production of plants and animals. Forty-two percent of the world\u2019s laborers are employed in agriculture. This makes it the most common occupation throughout the world.\n\nThe transofrmation of agriculture in many developing nations led to significant increases in agricultural production between the 1940s and the 1960s. Much of the increase in wheat production during what became known as the Green Revolution resulted from the introduction of better varieties developed by Dr. Norman Borlaug, a Distinguished Professor in our deparment who died in 2009. Called the Father of the Green Revolution, Dr. Borlaug was often credited with saving over a billion people from starvation. He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 in recognition of his contributions to world peace through increased food supply.\n\nChanging with the world\u2019s needs, the Soil and Crop Sciences Department has begun research and teaching in such areas as food science, water use and quality, bioenergy, turf ecology, and ecosystems, in addition to more standard agricultural areas. Some faculty members are also studying carbon sequestration, a method for capturing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and storing it in plants and soils.", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77843.2474", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.3479676244, "state": "TX", "street": "370 Olsen Blvd.", "latitude": 30.6115709883}, "talking_about_count": 17, "cover": {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash3/t1.0-9/s720x720/1619079_10152040188132955_36170305_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10152040188132955", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 100}, "public_transit": "http://transport.tamu.edu\n979.845.1971\n", "hours": {"fri_1_open": "08:00", "mon_2_open": "13:00", "thu_2_open": "13:00", "mon_2_close": "17:00", "tue_1_close": "12:00", "tue_2_open": "13:00", "fri_2_close": "17:00", "thu_2_close": "17:00", "tue_2_close": "17:00", "mon_1_open": "08:00", "mon_1_close": "12:00", "tue_1_open": "08:00", "thu_1_close": "12:00", "wed_1_open": "08:00", "wed_2_close": "17:00", "wed_1_close": "12:00", "fri_2_open": "13:00", "wed_2_open": "13:00", "thu_1_open": "08:00", "fri_1_close": "12:00"}, "phone": "979.845.3041", "is_published": true, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/tamusoilcrop", "likes": 1074, "were_here_count": 44, "website": "soilcrop.tamu.edu", "checkins": 44, "id": "46256627954", "name": "Texas A&M Soil & Crop Sciences"}

The pressure to win has been a contributing factor in many athletic scandals, within and without NCAA athletics.

The lesson is not, as some have suggested, \u201cdon\u2019t get caught,\u201d rather it is that such accomplishments could have been achieved without cheating.

{"category": "University", "website": "http://vetmed.tamu.edu/", "description": "The Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences is a college of Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. Founded in 1916, the Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences is one of only 31 colleges of veterinary medicine in the United States and Canada. It is consistently ranked as one of the top 5 vet schools in the country, according to U.S. News. The college offers an undergraduate program in Biomedical Sciences, a professional Doctor of Veterinary Medicine program, and numerous graduate programs relating to veterinary medicine and epidemiology.Mission statementAt the Texas A&M University College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, we support collaboration and teamwork that develops today's discoveries into proactive solutions for the benefit of animal, environmental, and public health, through our teaching, research, service, and outreach-impacting every Texan, every day.HistoryThe first record of an attempt to teach veterinary science at the Agricultural & Mechanical College was made in the third session of the college in 1878-79 when the college surgeon, D. Port Smythe, M.D., was also listed on the faculty as professor of anatomy, physiology and hygiene. No course is described, however, and no further record is available to indicate that such a course was actually given.The catalog of the fourth session also mentions proposed lectures in veterinary science, concerned mainly with domestic animals, but again no formal record exists of any actual courses given at the time.In April 1888, the college received a state appropriation of twenty-five hundred dollars for equipping and operating a Department of Veterinary Science, and on June 6, 1888, Dr. Mark Francis received his formal appointment to the faculty. This marked the real beginning of professional veterinary medicine in Texas; Francis was the first trained veterinarian at the college and would become one of the most distinguished men in United States veterinary medicine.", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "talking_about_count": 2, "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77840", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.3524093518, "state": "TX", "street": "", "latitude": 30.6128288001}, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/Texas-AM-College-of-Veterinary-Medicine-Biomedical-Sciences/109473875737530", "likes": 407, "were_here_count": 144, "is_community_page": true, "is_published": true, "checkins": 144, "id": "109473875737530", "name": "Texas A&M College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences"}

{"category": "Education", "username": "tamuroses", "about": "Meeting the challenges of our environment by mining the vast genetic diversity that exists in the genus Rosa. ", "can_post": true, "description": "The TAMU Rose Breeding and Genetics Program has been blessed by the contributions of two outstanding rose breeders: Robert E. Basye and Ralph Moore. It is dedicated to fulfill their visions and maintain their legacies in the pursuit of sustainable rose varieties and establishing a Center of Excellence for Rose and Ornamental Breeding and Genetics.\n\nThe Rose Research Program at Texas A&M University began in the early 1990s when Robert Basye, a retired Texas A&M University mathematician and dedicated rose breeder, came to the Department of Horticultural Sciences about continuing the work to which he had devoted his life time. His major goal was to produce \u201chealthy rose bushes on which to hang those beautiful flowers\u201d well adapted to our humid hot climate.  He had a few roses released such as \u201cBelinda\u2019s Dream\u201d, \u201cBasye\u2019s Blueberry\u201d, Basye\u2019s Legacy\u201d, and \u201cBasye\u2019s Purple\u201d.\n\nThe Rose research program at TAMU focused on the development of heat tolerant and black spot resistant roses. Over the years we have collected roses, both commercial and wild species, and collaborated with Brent Pemberton at the AgriLife Research and Extension Center in Overton in their evaluation for adaptation and particularly their resistance to black spot. This effort continues.\n\nOther research the program has done includes 1.) improved procedures to germinate rose seed, 2.) the use of black spot resistant rose species in the development of black spot resistant commercial roses 3.) the examination of rose genetic diversity to better understand the origin and relationships among roses 4.) the genetic analyses to elucidate the inheritance of various traits 5.) the development of a genetic map and tools useful in improving our breeding approaches and the 6.) evaluation of roses for their heat tolerance (ability to flower well in the Texas summer).\n\nThe breeding work with Dr. Basye\u2019s rose germplasm has resulted various thornless roses with good disease resistance, a highly fragrant rose with good disease resistance, and some highly floriferous black spot resistant selections. Unfortunately, although these are nice roses the range of colors and flower types was limited. Fortunately, the Rose Program has recently received a gift of roses from Ralph Moore who is known throughout the world as the Father of the Miniature Rose. This was a perfect match because the Basye rose germplasm has good disease resistance but it does not have the diversity of ornamental traits that Ralph Moore had put together over his 70 year career. Initial work combining these rose groups has resulted in such releases such as as \u201cGina\u2019s Rose\u201d and \u201cMy Stars\u201d.  \n\nRalph Moore\u2019s purpose with this gift to Texas A&M University was to strengthen the existing rose breeding program so it could preserve and use the rose germplasm that he had developed over his long career and expand what we know about the rose. Ralph always approached any breeding challenge with the question, \u201cWhy not?\u201d.  He was an explorer and was always encouraging others to explore. This is what the TAMU program is dedicated to do as it works with the public, visiting scientists, and students through its Center of Excellence for Rose and Ornamental Breeding and Genetics. \n\nAs both Robert Basye and Ralph Moore believed, the best way to continue with their long term goal of developing environmentally friendly and beautiful rose cultivars was to establish a privately endowed program at a University where the torch can be past.

It is unique compared to the typcial fraternity experience because you will be learning about ATO while buidling the fraternity on your campus. You will never be a pledge and not be hazed. \n\nAs America\u2019s Leadership Development Fraternity, ATO provides a great opportunity for men who are looking for a true fraternal experience.

More than 205,000 men have become ATOs and taken advantage of an experience like nothing else. \n\nThis is your chance to be a part of a brotherhood that provides you with support when you need it, and challenges you to be better than you were yesterday. A brotherhood for life. You will be able to interact with hundreds of A&M/ATO alumni, and connect to a growing network of 150,000 alumni ATOs across the country. Just imagine tapping into such a network for career opportunities upon graduation\u2026.\n\nYou are highly encouraged to check it out and share this information with your friends.

{"category": "University", "website": "http://www.tamu.edu/", "description": "Texas A&M University is a coeducational public research university located in College Station, Texas, United States. It is the flagship institution of the Texas A&M University System, the fourth-largest university in the United States and the largest university in Texas. Texas A&M's designation as a land, sea, and space grant institution reflects a broad range of research with ongoing projects funded by agencies such as the National Aeronautics and Space Administration , the National Institutes of Health, the National Science Foundation, and the Office of Naval Research. The school ranks in the top 20 American research institutes in terms of funding and has made notable contributions to such fields as animal cloning and petroleum engineering.The first public institution of higher education in Texas, though not the first general university in the state, the school opened on October 4, 1876 as the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas under the provisions of the Morrill Land-Grant Acts. Originally, the college taught no classes in agriculture, instead concentrating on classical studies, languages, literature, and applied mathematics. After four years, students could attain degrees in scientific agriculture, civil and mining engineering, and language and literature. Under the leadership of President James Earl Rudder, in the 1960s A&M desegregated, became coeducational, and dropped the requirement for participation in the Corps of Cadets. To reflect the institution's expanded roles and academic offerings, the Texas Legislature renamed the school to Texas A&M University in 1963. The letters \"A&M\", originally short for \"Agricultural and Mechanical\", are retained only as a link to the university's past. The school's students, alumni, and sports teams are known as \"Aggies\".", "category_list": [{"id": "108051929285833", "name": "College & University"}], "talking_about_count": 2, "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.344056, "state": "TX", "street": "", "latitude": 30.610369}, "phone": "979.845.3211", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/pages/TAMU/110176805678075", "likes": 319, "were_here_count": 6, "is_community_page": true, "is_published": true, "checkins": 6, "id": "110176805678075", "name": "TAMU"}

Students in the pre-professional and the professional degree programs enroll in design studio courses that tackle architectural projects similar to those faced by professional architects. In the studio projects, an emphasis is shared among the technical and expressive content of design work, the process by which students research, synthesize, and document their design ideas, and the creation of tangible products that achieve high quality of graphic and physical craft.\n\nThe studio courses are complemented by courses in technology, history, theory, and practice taught by renowned scholars in those fields to assure that students may design from a foundation of extensive and comprehensive knowledge of the built environment.\n\nComplementing the teaching program is an extensive program of inquiry in keeping with the norms of a research university. Faculty members engage in research, creative, and scholarly activities that enable maintenance of positions on the cutting edge of architectural knowledge. Students in the Master of Science in Architecture and the PhD in Architecture investigate open questions in the field and produce a thesis or dissertation that contributes to the body of knowledge of architecture.\n\nThe department is also committed to service to the people of Texas, the United States, and the world through engagement in projects of tangible and lasting value to communities. The studio method and the research activities provide students with many opportunities to work with under served segments of the population, such as the people of the colonies along the U.S. and Mexico border, those affected by hurricanes and other natural disasters, and disadvantaged people throughout our communities.", "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "College of Architecture, Texas A&M University", "zip": "77845-3137", "country": "United States"}, "talking_about_count": 0, "cover": {"source": "https://fbcdn-sphotos-c-a.akamaihd.net/hphotos-ak-ash2/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/384111_426401097420203_1022982552_n.png?oh=3caf50c8a7dccda9fa9789616ca2af30&oe=53B768A4&__gda__=1404398398_27833b0f5cdeff3a3b7012f024a2187a", "cover_id": "426401097420203", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0}, "mission": "The mission of the Department of Architecture is to create and disseminate knowledge of interiors, buildings, and the built and virtual environment, influencing our society to achieve a built environment that achieves the triple bottom line of sustainability: economic, social, and ecological justice.

Borlaug \u2014 by playing a key role in fighting world hunger.\n\nTo that end, the Borlaug Institute\u2019s primary work is planning and executing major agricultural and economic development projects inside developing countries across the globe. Each project aims to boost self-sufficiency in one or several agricultural disciplines while improving the economy of the country in which it is implemented. Together, these projects work to increase the world\u2019s food resources and food productivity at large.\n\nOur most highly venerated development project to date, the 2006-2012 Rwanda SPREAD project \u2014 SPREAD is an acronym for \u201cSustaining Partnerships to enhance Rural Enterprise and Agribusiness Development\u201d \u2014transformed Rwanda's agricultural economy most notably by using new planting practices to help native farmers produce high quality, specialty coffee beans that are now sold to major retailers like Starbucks. \n\nProjects like SPREAD, but with varying agricultural objectives, run concurrently in several countries at any given time \u2014 nations like South Sudan, Guatemala, Iraq and Afghanistan. \n\nThe Borlaug Institute\u2019s staff coordinates development projects from headquarters at Texas A&M University in College Station, Texas. But it is university staff members \u2014 renowned Texas A&M professors and scientists \u2014 who travel into developing countries to make contact with native peoples and carry out our work at the ground level. And they don\u2019t do it alone.\n\nPartnerships\n\nWhile the Borlaug Institute serves as the leading, or primary, organization for most of the development projects we undertake \u2014 in some cases we assist other organizations \u2014 implementing each project requires myriad partnerships with governmental, academic and private organizations the world over. \n\nThe SPREAD project, for example, utilized partnerships with: the U.S. Agency for International Development, or USAID; the National University of Rwanda; The National Agricultural Export Development Board of Rwanda, or NAEB; the Specialty Coffee Association of America and a litany of private coffee bean buyers and roasters. Partnership systems for each of our ongoing development projects are equally complex and many partners work with The Borlaug Institute on several projects at once.  \n\nInternational Training \n\nIn addition to the work we do abroad, The Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture coordinates long- and short-term agricultural training programs in College Station for agriculture professionals from developing countries. Trainees include government leaders, university professors, scientists and students. Training takes place at the Texas A&M University College of Agriculture and Life Sciences and is intended to impart the latest practices in a range of agricultural disciplines. International training provides a set of tools that trainees can take back to disseminate in their home countries \u2014 another way to promote global agricultural self-sufficiency. The Borlaug Institute\u2019s international training programs require many of the same partnerships as our development projects and are funded via many of the same sources. \n\nFunding\n\nThe Borlaug Institute\u2019s initiatives are funded through a range of sources, the largest of which is USAID, which accounts for about 52 percent of The Institute\u2019s $55 million portfolio. The U.S. Department of State and the U.S. Department of Defense account for a combined 30 percent of funding while the U.S. Department of Agriculture, various private organizations and other nonprofit foundations comprise the remainder. The Borlaug Institute competes with like-minded organizations and universities for the funding and contracts that allow us to carry out the work we do around the world. \n\n", "talking_about_count": 48, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash2/t1.0-9/s720x720/396976_10151318577128676_1927305020_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10151318577128676", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0}, "mission": "To employ agricultural science to feed the hungry, and to support, equity, economic growth, quality of life and mutual respect among peoples", "founded": "2006", "phone": "+1-979-845-4164", "is_published": true, "link": "https://www.facebook.com/BorlaugTAMU", "likes": 2264, "were_here_count": 37, "general_info": "Norman Borlaug Institute for International Agriculture, Texas AgriLife Research, Texas A&M University System", "checkins": 37, "id": "30077973675", "website": "http://borlaug.tamu.edu/", "location": {"city": "College Station", "zip": "77843-2477", "country": "United States", "longitude": -96.3509332468, "state": "TX", "street": "578 John Kimbrough Blvd. Suite 201", "latitude": 30.6060176809}}

For 90 years, Texas A&M students\u2014known as Aggies\u2014built and burned a bonfire on campus each autumn. Known to the Aggie community simply as \"Bonfire\", the annual autumn event symbolized Aggie students' \"burning desire to beat the hell outta t.u.\", a derogatory nickname for the University of Texas. The bonfire was traditionally lit around Thanksgiving in conjunction with festivities surrounding the annual college football game.Early yearsThe students of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas, known as Aggies, burned their first bonfire on November 18, 1907 to congratulate the football team on a recent win. The first on-campus Aggie Bonfire, a heap of trash and debris, was burned in 1909 to generate enthusiasm for a variety of sporting events. A decade later, the focus of the event narrowed to the annual rivalry game between Texas A&M and the University of Texas, held near Thanksgiving Day. Little information was recorded about the early Bonfires; the 1921 Texas A&M yearbook mentioned the \"final rally\" of the students before the game against Texas, but did not refer to a bonfire. Six years later, the school yearbook published a photograph of the event."}

Habitat seeks to eliminate poverty housing and to make decent shelter a matter of conscience and action. The Bryan/College Station Affiliate of Habitat for Humanity International was chartered in 1989 along with the Texas A&M Campus Chapter. Through the work of both affluent and needy people, Habitat builds new relationships and a sense of community as well as new housing through family nurturing, community education, and\nconstruction projects.\n\nThrough volunteer labor, management, expertise,\nand tax-deductible donations of money and materials, Habitat builds and repairs homes. Houses are sold at no profit to partner families, and no-interest mortgages are issued over a fixed period. Costs of homes differ relative to location, labor, land and materials. Homes in the Bryan/College Station Area cost about $59,500 on average.\n\nMonthly mortgage payments of approximately $375\nwith 0% interest, including taxes and insurance, are repaid over 20 to 30 years and deposited into a revolving \"Fund for Humanity\" which supports the construction of more houses. Habitat is not a giveaway program, but is a joint venture in which those who benefit from the housing ministry are involved in the work at various levels. Each homeowner family is required to invest 400-500 hours of \"sweat equity\" into the construction of their home. 100 of these hours can be donated from friends and family of the homeowners.\n\nThis reduces the cost of the house, fosters pride of\nownership among family members, and lays the foundation for the development of positive relationships with other people. Aggie Habitat for Humanity is the Campus Chapter of Habitat for Humanity International at Texas A&M University. A&M students, former students, faculty, and staff are invited and encouraged to volunteer and work on any Aggie Habitat project.

On their way down to the field they stopped by a janitors closet and borrowed 5 white janitor's ducts similar to the ones we wear today and then they ran down onto the field and lead a few yells.

After losing the first two games of their football season in 1922, the freshman class marched around Kyle Field together, led by a piccolo player and a brass horn to the tune of a mournful funeral march, trying to break the \"curse\" of the team. When they became seniors three years later, they decided to take one final walk around the campus together, this time to remember their time spent in Aggieland and the friends and memories they had made. As they walked single file, each man with his hand on the shoulder of his friend before him, an observer noted that they \"looked like elephants, about to die.\" Thus the tradition of Elephant Walk was born. In subsequent years, it became a tradition reserved for seniors that takes place each year before the last football game of the season, traditionally the night that Bonfire would burn.\n\nAs the years progressed, Elephant Walk became a much-anticipated celebration. Unfortunately, it also became a time for the junior class to sabotage the seniors. Elephant Walk, through the 1980's and early 1990's was marked as a sloppy display of ill-will and competition between the classes. Injuries frequently resulted as well. This was disgracing our campus and almost ruined the tradition. In 1993, the first Jr. E-Walk gave the juniors an alternative and a new tradition was born. The juniors have their own walk and speaker now and participate with the senior class in the games, pictures with elephants, food and other festivities.\n\nElephant Walk and Jr. E-Walk are important to this university. They unify classes of thousands of diverse students. The Elephant Walk line has been known to stretch a mile as 3,000 seniors sprawl across campus. Sales from merchandise with the logos of these events usually earn the junior and senior classes about $20,000 that goes to the purchase of a class gift after graduation.", "talking_about_count": 2, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-a.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-frc3/t1.0-9/s720x720/988320_460734357378089_633125266_n.jpg", "cover_id": "460734357378089", "offset_x": 50, "offset_y": 0}, "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "", "zip": "77843", "country": "United States"}, "website": "http://elephantwalk.tamu.edu/node/1", "link": "https://www.facebook.com/AggieElephantWalk", "likes": 1645, "were_here_count": 0, "is_published": true, "id": "187277854723742", "name": "Elephant Walk and Jr. E-Walk"}
