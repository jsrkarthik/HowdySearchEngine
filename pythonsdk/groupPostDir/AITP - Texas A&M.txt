Being an AITP officer is a great opportunity to expand your leadership skills and attractiveness to employers by being a part of one of the most active AITP student chapters in the country.

Once the speeches for a position are given, we will send those candidates out of earshot so that we may take a hand count of the votes and see which officer won that position. The reason we count the votes on the spot is to allow the candidates to run for multiple positions, rather than being unable to be an officer if they don't win the first position available.

Just to be clear, we are not basing our decision on your qualifications as an employee. We will be looking to ensure that it is a resume that is formatted properly, well worded, and college level.\n\nJust to clarify, even if you submitted a resume last semester, you will need to submit one for this book as well, as we do not have access to last semester's resumes.\n\nYou MUST be a paid member in order to have your resume placed in the resume book.
