Wayne Stark trip to Chicago (Jan 5 - Jan 7)\n\nAll,\n\nEvery year, just after New Year's, the MSC sponsors the J. Wayne Stark Trip.  This trip provides a great opportunity for a handful of Aggie students to visit leading graduate schools in business and law in the Chicagoland area such as Northwestern University and the University of Chicago. This year, 18 Aggies will be visiting Chicago on Sunday, January 5th through Tuesday, January 7th. Typically, we will provide room and board for the Aggie student guests in order to help defray costs for this trip.  However, the format has changed for the trip this year and the students will instead be staying at a hotel.\n\nWhile this is different from the format of prior years, we do encourage Ags to participate in the scheduled events for the weekend in order to offer any thoughts you have regarding living in Chicago and of course to encourage the usual Aggie bonding that we are so known for. \n\nWe have planned activities as follows:\n- Bricks on Sunday Night 5:00 PM (costs covered by the MSC) Jan - 5th\n\n- Second City on Sunday Night 6:30 PM (if you are interested in joining, you will need to get your own ticket and inform them that you are part of the \"Texas A&M\" group in order to be sat with the group.  Cost is $31.50, http://www.secondcity.com/performances/detail/1656).\n\n- Adobo Grill (Old Town) on Monday Night Jan 6th at 6:30 PM for students and any interested Ags.  Cost will be based on a price fixe menu that is yet to be determined but should be about $35/head.  Please RSVP if interested.  If you have not been to this dinner at Adobo Grill, they put on a great spread and have awesome margaritas, so please join us!!\n\nThis trip is a great opportunity to hear about the university, how much it has changed and in many ways, how it has stayed the same. If you have an interest in coming out to any of the events, please contact me and let me know.", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "40168821395_10151769492901396", "description": "The Second City Touring Company brings their hilarious Laugh Out Loud Tour home to Chicago for an unforgettable night of classic and original sketch comedy and trademark improvisation.

I am a 1989 graduate of Texas A&M University and the author of a women\u2019s fiction mystery series (Saving Grace of the Katie & Annalise series, with new release Leaving Annalise coming out soon) and of relationship humor books.\n\nI am writing for a couple of reasons:\n\n1. To let you know that, while I am only in town one day, I am happy to network with any size group of Aggies, whether at, before, or after my scheduled signing event, formally or just for a cup of coffee. If this date isn\u2019t convenient, please still consider me a resource. I also present or do Q&As via Skype on a wide variety of topics (my books, writing in general, motivational/inspirational). I love to meet fellow Aggies and share resources.\n\n2. To invite you and your membership to the signing I am having at Barbara's Bookstore on 810 Village Center Dr., Burr Ridge, IL 60527 from 6-8pm.\n\nFor more information on my workshops, visit http://pamelahutchins.com/speaking.\n\nThanks, and have a good one!", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "40168821395_10151413478976396", "description": "Pamela is a past member of the National Speakers' Association and a dynamic speaker as well as a former law school instructor.

This trip provides a great opportunity for a handful of Aggie students to visit leading graduate schools in business and law in the Chicagoland area such as Northwestern University and the University of Chicago.  This year, 18 Aggies (14 guys, 4 girls) will be visiting Chicago on Saturday, January 5th through Tuesday, January 8th. In order to help defray costs for this trip and to encourage some Aggie bonding, we provide room and board for our guests for these three evenings.\n\nWe need volunteers (already have three) who are willing to offer up their living quarters for a minimum of two guests in the city of Chicago. We currently need about 9 hosts. The MSC asks that we keep all of the visiting Aggies in pairs for purposes of traveling about the city.  The students are responsible for their own transportation.\n\nWe have planned activities as follows:\n\nBricks on Saturday Night 5:00 PM (covered by the MSC) Jan - 5th\n\nSecond City on Sunday Night 7:00 PM (covered by the MSC) - Jan 6th\n\nAdobo Grill on Monday Night for students and host families 7:00 PM - Jan 7th\n\n\u00b7         If you are not one of the host families but are interested in attending one or more of the events, contact us and we will make arrangements, however you will be asked to support you costs of the event (ticket cost, dinner cost, etc.)\n\nThe hosts will get to enjoy those events FREE OF CHARGE, however, anyone else wishing to attend will have to RSVP.\n\nThis trip is a great opportunity to hear about the university, how much it has changed (like we have a HEISMAN winner!!!) and in many ways, how it has stayed the same.  If you can be of assistance, please respond and I'll contact you with further details.\n\nBeat the hell outta Oklahoma!!\n\nGig Em'", "type": "status", "id": "40168821395_10151130681246396", "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTExNjA4MzE2ODEzOTY=", "before": "MTAxNTExMzg0ODUxNDYzOTY="}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "1020212992", "name": "Mike Pflueger"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-12-21T18:06:52+0000", "message": "Hello ya'll, hope the holidays stresses have been minimal and everyone has been enjoying the holidays so far.

LSU gave the Aggies the blueprint for beating Alabama last Saturday when the Tigers ran 85 offensive plays, almost 30 more than Alabama's average on defense in its first eight games. LSU had a time of possession advantage of almost 19 minutes. In short, the Alabama defense was gassed. Look for Texas A&M to really pick up the tempo with Manziel, who is averaging an incredible 383 yards of total offense. If the Aggies can get to 80 plays then they have a shot. But there is a caveat. Texas A&M has to get to 80 plays without turning the ball over.\"", "type": "status", "id": "40168821395_10151087899446396"}

Most affected were horses.  \n\nThe Illinois Horse Rescue of Will County was also affected, in years past they raised their own feed but due to the drought they did not harvest any hay or alfalpha. \n\nAt any given time the rescue has around 30-40 horses on site and another 100 they are observing on farmers property.  Due to not harvesting any hay this year their number one expense has turned from maintance of the animals to feed for the animals.  Currently the rescue needs to raise enough funds to purchase 6000 bails of hay.  Also, with winter coming fencing is in need of winter maintance.  The resuce is looking to raise a total of $50,000.  \n\nEvery little bit helps so if you can or you know someone who can please click the link below and see for yourself.  \n\nAlso, The Resuce is a 501c3 so all donations are tax deductible.\n\nwww.illinoishorserescue.org/\n\nThank you Ags and Gig'em\n\nRichard Wilkie '01", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "40168821395_10151075745066396", "description": "Illinois Horse Rescue of Will County, Inc. provides horse rescue to the Chicagoland area including Kankakee, Peotone, Crete, Chicago, Naperville, Schaumburg and Arlington Heights."}

At the time we met up with them, they had already exceeded the $4,000 mark and were well on their way to their stated goal of $10,000.  We shared stories and adult beverages for about three hours before they decided to call it a night as they were heading out early the next morning to Miller Park in Milwaukee.  After that, they will have had 14 more stadiums to journey to (and Aggie Clubs to meet with) before heading back to Texas.  These guys were enthused about their campaign and it looks like it will be a great success.  If you wish to find out more or would like to consider a donation to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for finding a cure for Parkinson's, you can follow this link \n\nhttp://www2.michaeljfox.org/goto/bthop .   The donation will go directly into the Michael J.

My girlfriend is a native Chicagoan and knows the city very well so Craigslist wasn't a bad option. Loyola is in the Rogers park area which is right off of the cta red line. It would be easy for u to find an apartment anywhere by the red line and have an easy commute to loyola. It all just depends on how much you can afford and what type of neighborhood you would like to be in. The red line runs from the north side of Chicago all the way to the south side. I would recommend looking in the lakeside neighborhood or north central neighborhood. Most people would probably tell you to look in Lincoln park or wrigleyville but I encourage looking at other neighborhoods that are more affordable and in my opinion offer more. The Chicago apartment finders will take you place to place to see different places in different neighborhoods. \nAlso for public transportation... Which would be ur best bet at getting around the city without dealing with traffic... Look up the Chicago card, it is a card for the buses and trains that is linked to you credit card.

I understand 6 months is a long time and I would be willing to pay rent to whoever housed me. If 6 months is too long I would also appreciate anyone who could possibly house me for a few weeks while I found an apartment to live in. Any help anyone can give me would be greatly appreciated. \n\nI do not smoke, I drink occasionally on Fridays and weekends, and am very clean. I will help around the house as much as possible as well.\nThank you for your help I greatly appreciate it.

I've met many of you at various Chicagoland A&M Club activities and Muster; I'm Raymond Fischer, '00, and my wife Lee and I moved up here about a year ago.

Luckily, my wife--a teacher--was able to find a job before we moved, but it hasn't been that easy for me.  \n\nI originally wanted to try to find a position outside of the practice of law--something to which I am still very much open--but I've been told by multiple recruiters that, \"well, but you're a lawyer, so...I mean, there's nothing I/we can do...\"  \n\nHowever, I feel like I'd be a great asset to a company or entity, and could use the experience I gained in commercial litigation to great benefit; if nothing else, the time I spent in the field made me a very hard worker who's willing to do anything.  At this point, Ags, I'm open to any ideas and advice.  All ideas and thoughts are welcome.  \n\nThanks for the help, guys!
