The children are now ages 11 months and 2.5 years, but because their mother is having to undergo chemotherapy again for a recurrence of breast cancer we must have in-home help for our babies.\n\nYou must be English-speaking, a non-smoker from a non-smoking household, experienced with babies/toddlers, energetic, creative, fun-loving, able to lift 30 pounds and able to climb stairs while carrying 30 pounds. CPR/First Aid certified is preferred.  Additionally, you must have a clean driving record and be able to put the babies into their carseats in our car to get them to playdates, preschool (for the toddler), pediatrician appointments, errands, etc. \n  \nBecause mommy's chemo makes her weak and tired, our previous nanny also helped with light housework related to the children like keeping their bathroom sink/mirror area clean, vacuuming their bedrooms and play areas, helping with their laundry if mom fell behind on it, keeping the wood/tile floors clean of crumbs or other things that might wind up in a crawling baby's mouth, changing diaper pail bags, etc. \n\nWe live in Leesburg, VA and the hours we need help are when dad is at work: Monday - Friday 8 a.m.-5:30 p.m. \n\nPay negotiable and based on experience, references and certifications (range from $14-$22/hour). \n\nPlease contact Ed at silvented@yahoo.com or by text (preferable) or phone 602-703-1899. \n                                                                  ######", "type": "status", "id": "2209978458_10151991830618459"}

The bar is unique in that its business model is built around the idea of a 'philanthropub' (all profit goes to selected non-profit organizations listed on your bill of which you can choose to put your bar tab money towards). Some of you have probably heard of this up and coming bar because it has been in the media a lot lately due to its mix of fun and social responsibility. You can check out the full story of CAUSE at Causedc.org and even browse their menu and nightly activities. My favor today is that you head over to the site listed below and vote for CAUSE - DC in the GOOD.is \"Good Maker Challenge.\" GOOD has partnered with TOMS to create this competition of funding good ideas that move our world.\n\nSo, take a couple of seconds and follow the link, vote, and smile knowing you are helping a great business in the DC area grow and sustain its model. Then, help us spread the word! There are only 4 days left, so get after it.\n\nI also encourage an Aggie Happy Hour here one day as the bar truly is a great environment and 100% of the profit goes to NGOs both local and international.\n\nThanks and Gig'Em!", "type": "status", "id": "2209978458_10151619852168459", "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTE2MTk5NDIzODM0NTk=", "before": "MTAxNTE2MTk5MzUyNzg0NTk="}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "501061985", "name": "Ravyn Miller"}, "like_count": 1, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-06-10T01:50:06+0000", "message": "I love that place!

Since I live in northern VA, we can get together for your facial or if you're too busy for personal pampering I'll send your goodie bag straight to you (and you can send me your before/after pics)! It doesn't cost you a dime to enter this contest BUT imagine if you win ... (50 donation winners and 1 grand prize winner) ... what charity would you choose? It's about giving back to others! Will you help me reach 30 or more women this week ... ask your friends to join you too (who wouldn't want to be pampered OR get a goodie bag customized just for them! Friends = free product for you too!) Log on to www.marykay.com/ktansey - click on the MYMK link at the top - register & fill out your profile and we'll set a date that's good for you or I'll send you everything you need! (If you're currently working with a consultant please contact her ... for anyone you refer - they must be 18 or older for the contest but I have great products for women & men of all ages).

My roommate furnished our living room and kitchen so the only thing you would need is bedroom furniture. The complex is very convenient to 395, and is a quick 15 min drive to Oldtown and 20 minute drive to DC. King Street metro is 1.5 miles away, and there is bus stop right across from the building that will take you to the metro.\n\nRent is $812 plus half of the utilities. All in I pay about $930/month which includes internet and Dish Network. Parking is free and there are tons of visitor spots for when you want to have guests over. The apartment is very spacious and gets lots of natural light. It has a washer/dryer, living room, balcony with French doors and separate dining area. Roommate is a 24 year old female Clemson grad. She's pretty awesome :) Please email me at lauren.thompson2011@gmail.com if you're interested!\n\nhttp://www.homeproperties.com/apartments/VA/Alexandria/Newport-Village/tabid/90/cid/10020/maid/80/Default.aspx", "type": "status", "id": "2209978458_10151233226388459"}

I have not yet completed my degree but I am a planner and I have a high interest in the finance and political aspects in the field of education.

I know this is a difficult task but after speaking with several advisers at Texas A&M they  have suggested I contact as many people as possible to figure out what the best way to land an internship would be. I am contacting fellow Aggies in the DC area to see if any of you have any suggestions as to who to contact regarding my interest or if you know of any internships or jobs that I could work for, for free, in order to gain the political and financial experience that I am searching for in the field of Education.

He was part of the less than 1% of Americans who are serving our nation in our military today during time of war.\" I realize its not as sensational as wondering what Kim is going to do with her 50 carat diamond ring, but in MY humble opinion, its 50 times more important.", "type": "status", "id": "2209978458_10150376679648459"}
