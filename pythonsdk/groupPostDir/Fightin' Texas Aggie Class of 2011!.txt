The entertainment provided at the First Yell event was a collection provided by A&M organizations such as Singing Cadets and Aggie Wranglers, followed by a comedian of national prominence.\n \nThis year will not lack for excitement for the first Midnight Yell Practice, because it will precede the first SEC home football game in the history of Texas A&M. The opponent will be the Florida Gators. Because it is the first year for A&M in the SEC, there is a lot of interest in A&M by our SEC brethren. They want to see, first hand, some of A&M's nationally recognized traditions. At or near the top of their list is Midnight Yell Practice.\n \nTo insure a proper event for such a historical occasion, First Yell is changing also. This year, the current Yell Leaders and the Former Yell leaders Association will provide a concert in the Zone at Kyle Field. The concert is titled \"Texas Music - Aggie Style\". The performers are Robert Earl Keen \u201978  Rick Trevino '93, and Granger Smith '02. The event will begin at 8:00 pm and conclude at 11:00 pm, thirty minutes before the start of Midnight Yell Practice.\n \nWe hope that our friends and SEC brethren from Florida will attend First Yell and they, along with all of us \"Old Ags\", can then enjoy a front row seat view of what is expected to be the largest attendance at Midnight Yell Practice in the history of Texas A&M.  The tickets to this historic event can be purchased from the 12th Man Foundation ticket office by visiting the website, www.12thmanfoundation.com or by calling 1-888-992-4443 or 979-843-2311.", "type": "link", "id": "2211293585_10151031714858586", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif"}
