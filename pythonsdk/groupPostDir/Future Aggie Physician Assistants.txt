Some schools, however, specifically out-of-state programs require you to self-report your scores in the section provided on the CASPA portal. So please make sure you are attuned to which schools require you to do so. As far as in-state programs are concerned, nothing has changed. Yes, certain schools like UTMB have now required GRE scores be sent directly to their institution, but still nothing has changed. Either directly after taking your exam, or through your ETS-GRE portal once scores have been posted (approx 10 days later), you can then enter the codes provided for each school and they will without a doubt be sent to the right location. UTMB has recently changed their code to meet the aforementioned requirement of having scores sent directly to them. Therefore, you just simply enter the code: 0437 and it will be routed through CASPA and right on to UTMB. No worries.

I just wanted to pass along some info to any girls that will be attending UTMB this next year:\n\nOne of my best friends, Hannah, who is also a PA student with me is looking for a girl to take over a room in their house this next year. The house is a 3 bedroom/1 bathroom house that is super cute and soooo close to campus. It has been totally renovated inside so it is really nice! Hannah and her other roommate Alex will be in and out of the house for the year on rotations, but they would love for someone the fill the 3rd bedroom. Rent is $500 and the house already has all the appliances! Anyways, I am just passing on information to you guys because I am sure some of you are trying to figure out housing if you are coming to UTMB. This is a super great deal, because you will basically get the house to yourself (with the exceptions of months were Alex and Hannah are home for a rotation) and only have to pay $500! And when they are home, you will have 2 wonderful roommates! SO if anyone is interested you can email Hannah at hannahsandifer@gmail.com!\n\nIf you have any questions you can message me and I can get you in contact with Hannah! \n\nP.S. Sorry boys, this only applies to girls :)\nAND I think the bedroom comes furnished!\n\nJaney", "type": "status", "id": "283650132494_10151601069847495"}

So I was wondering, I know y'all only have 3 meetings left but can I still go to them? I would pay dues if needed and would love to be considered active but I know to be considered active I have to attend 4 and there are only 3 meetings left. So any information would be great.

I worked on my CASPA app off and on for a few months. It does take focus, so when you do work on it be sure you aren't distracted! I found it beneficial to complete one section of the app before moving on to the next, but the order in which you complete it really depends more on personal preference. Be sure to have your 3 references lined up as soon as the app opens so you can get that taken care of early. Once I completed the CASPA (shoot for before July 15!) and sent my official transcripts in it was sent out in about a week and a half. Don't forget to allow time to do all of the supplemental applications- usually they ask similar questions but some are completely different than others. Because of some stuff that happened with my family and an extended summer trip I didn't get most of the supplementals done until really close to the deadlines for those, which differ according to the school. Even so, that wasn't really a problem. As for the GRE stuff, I had a glitch with sending my GRE scores because they lost my information in their system somehow, so most of the schools I applied to didn't get them until September and it definitely wasn't a problem!
