TaYouKi is described as a Teaching Assistant for Young Kids. The system seeks to help children in the initial learning stages to develop new relevant skills through novel forms of computer interaction and autonomous feedback from an intelligent user interface.\n\nThe TaYouKI is well descriped according to it\u2019s visual structure, the recognition provided in the system and the agent intelligence applied to engage with the children\n\nThe TaYouKi tool is still in a prototype stage and as stated by the authors a more formal evaluation is required to fully assess the potentiality of the system. The authors\u2019 account for how they want to conduct the evaluation sessions with references to existing techniques and how children, teachers and parents should evaluate the system. They even account for preferred location conditions and system requirements. Unfortunately, these descriptions do not provide any proof-of-concept for TaYouKI. Thus, I would suggest that the paper is accepted as an exploratory (short) paper \u2013 as an evaluation of the prototype is crucial to the proof-of-concept.\n\nI would welcome a full paper on TaYouKi when the evaluation suggested in the paper is conducted. Based on this evaluation fellow researchers can judge the system\u2019s ability to assist young kids in their early writing, as proposed by the authors.\n\n----------------------- REVIEW 2 ---------------------\nPAPER: 46\nTITLE: Intelligent Tutoring for Early Writers and Artists Using Sketch Recognition\nAUTHORS: Francisco Vides, Tracy Hammond, Paul Taele, Jimmy Ho and Hong-Hoe Kim\n\nOVERALL RATING: -1 (weak reject)\nREVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (high)\nImportance of research problem or question(s): 4 (good)\nImportance of contribution: 3 (fair)\nQuality of research methods for the problem: 2 (poor)\nInnovation and originality: 4 (good)\nRelevance to conference: 3 (fair)\nClarity and quality of writing: 3 (fair)\n\nPlease write your review of the paper here. Please respond to the following points:\n1. Briefly summarize the main contribution.\n2. Please provide a justification for the overall rating.\n3. Please provide specific information to help the authors improve the work.\n\nThis is interesting work, pulling together a number of technologies\ntowards the end of helping children to learn to write and sketch.\n\nHowever there are a number of problems with the presentation that could do\nwith some attention.\n\nOne of the major problems I have is the purpose of the research. I am not\nat all convinced that the work hangs together.\n\nThe first sign that there is an issue here is the title which is a little\nmisleading. The approach may one day be suitable for early writers but now\nit seems mainly designed for young children learning to draw composite\nobjects.\n\nAnother symptom is the expressed intention to evaluate the children's\nknowledge of geometrical shapes. There are also the underlying issues\nconnected with manual dexterity.\n\nI could go on, but it quickly becomes apparent that the goals of the\nresearch can be made much clearer. It would be useful to see all the goals\n(and subgoals) given in one or two paragraphs. The research als oneeds to\nbe placed succinctly within the broader research suggested by the title.\n\nOther aspects of the work give rise to some feelings of discomfort. For\nexample, the issue of feedback. Several times its importance is stressed -\nand I would agree that without good feedback the project is likely to fail.\nGiven the current description, the quality of feedback could be state of\nthe art, good or deficient. Some additional material is needed to explain.\nThere's also been quite a lot of work on feedback in the last - say - 10\nyears. It would be a good idea to draw on it.\n\nOne observation about feedback: it would seem that the feedback system has\na very limited memory. For example, suppose that the child keeps making\nthe same error - it would seem that this system would not be able to use\nthis information to shape the feedback. Also, the way in which emotion is\ninjected into the feedback does not seem to be grounded in any educational\ntheory. Without further careful description the implementation seems to be\na sequence of reasonable decisions rather than the result of a systematic\napproach.\n\nAnother set of problems is associated with emotions. The emotional state\nof the agent is used to determine some aspect of the feedback. The agent's\nemotions appear to be determined mainly through the detection of a wrong\nanswer, a right answer and a timeout. While the state transition\nnetwork does provide for a more interesting dynamics it is by no means\nclear that there is any firm theoretical basis for why it is the agent's\nemotional state that should be used for determining feedback. Nor does\nthere seem to be any enquiry into what kinds of emotion should be\ndisplayed to generate the best responses from children.\n\nThe notion of personalisation is also part of the work but this is\nrelatively unanalysed. It could be that personalisation is simply\nassociated with each child taking a potentially different path through the\nsystem. This seems a very weak notion of personalisation. An alternative\nview is that the notion of agent personality and system personalisation\nhave been conflated. Some text is needed to clarify what is meant by\npersonalisation and how it is delivered.\n\nThe zone of proximal development is mentioned several times but it is not\nclear how it is determined that the learner is being presented with\nappropriate tasks. The same issue occurs with the notion of scaffolding -\nit is mentioned but how it gets delivered is a mystery. Some text is\nneeded to clarify how scaffolding is delivered.\n\nThere is mention of an \"automatic measurement of engagement\" - but there is\nlittle or nothing about how this is achieved. I think this needs\nclarification too.\n\nSection 4.5 and the future evaluation plans: I don't see any reference to\ndrawing out the thoughts and feelings of the children themselves. Why not?\nSince children are perfectly capable of producing some data - even if it is\nhard to interpret - the onus is on the authors to explain why no data will\nbe obtained directly from the children themselves.\n\nWith such a wide ranging agenda it becomes difficult to describe anything\nin sufficient detail. The paper needs a major rewrite to pull out of it\nsomething substantial for the audience.\n\n----------------------- REVIEW 3 ---------------------\nPAPER: 46\nTITLE: Intelligent Tutoring for Early Writers and Artists Using Sketch Recognition\nAUTHORS: Francisco Vides, Tracy Hammond, Paul Taele, Jimmy Ho and Hong-Hoe Kim\n\nOVERALL RATING: -1 (weak reject)\nREVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 3 (high)\nImportance of research problem or question(s): 4 (good)\nImportance of contribution: 3 (fair)\nQuality of research methods for the problem: 3 (fair)\nInnovation and originality: 3 (fair)\nRelevance to conference: 4 (good)\nClarity and quality of writing: 2 (poor)\n\nPlease write your review of the paper here. Please respond to the following points:\n1. Briefly summarize the main contribution.\n\nThis paper describes a sketch recognition system designed to help young children learn how to draw and write. This sytem, TaYouKi, is capable of recognizing primitive shapes (like squares and triangles) as well as a couple of numbers and letters that are drawn using a tablet-based system or a mouse. The system also includes an animated avatar that reacts to the students' progress. A student interacting with the system is first presented with a task, the system tracks the student's actions and the avatar responds to encourage engagement and successful task completion.\n\nThe paper describes the system and its implementation, situates the contribution with respect to related work and outlines plans for a future user study.\n\nThe core contribution is a novel system that consists of: 1) a sketch recognition system designed especially for children and 2) the avatar that responds to student performance.\n\n2. Please provide a justification for the overall rating.\n\nThis area is interesting and relevant to the conference, and the system the authors built seems to be functional. However, I have three concerns about this paper.\n\nFirst, it is difficult to know how novel the contribution is. The survey of related work does not clearly explain what features are unique to TaYouKi and what features have been implemented in previous work. The system is not introducing novel sketch recognition techniques. The avatar/engagement tracking interface does not seem particularly novel either. It is a farily simple finite state machine that responds to a limited set of inputs from the user. Are the authors arguing that the combination of the recognition engine, target user audience, and avatar system are original? If so, this case is not clearly made.\n\nSecond, the authors have not yet conducted any structured user studies, which makes it difficult to know how successful their design and implementation is. I don't think user studies should be required of all IDC submissions--truly groundbreaking systems can be contributions in and of themselves. But, documentation of interactions with people would really strengthen this submission, given the questions about TaYouKi's novelty.\n\nFinally, the paper is not very well written. In several places it is difficult to follow and it has several grammatical errors.\n\n3. Please provide specific information to help the authors improve the work.\n\nThe paper would be greatly improved by a clear statement about the novelty of the work described in the paper.\n\nFigures 1 and 2 don't really communicate useful information. These could be deleted. Figure 7 should appear earlier in the text, where it is first mentioned.\n\n----------------------- REVIEW 4 ---------------------\nPAPER: 46\nTITLE: Intelligent Tutoring for Early Writers and Artists Using Sketch Recognition\nAUTHORS: Francisco Vides, Tracy Hammond, Paul Taele, Jimmy Ho and Hong-Hoe Kim\n\nOVERALL RATING: 2 (accept)\nREVIEWER'S CONFIDENCE: 2 (medium)\nImportance of research problem or question(s): 3 (fair)\nImportance of contribution: 3 (fair)\nQuality of research methods for the problem: 4 (good)\nInnovation and originality: 4 (good)\nRelevance to conference: 4 (good)\nClarity and quality of writing: 5 (excellent)\n\nThe paper gives a detailed explanation of the design of a tool to support young children's motor skills in using a pen to write and to draw. The tool is envisaged as supporting the teacher's work. This was very positive: the authors have not fall into the trap of assuming that the teacher can be replaced (so many studies forget that learning is an inherently social activity and that the importance of relationship is particularly crucial for young children's learning). It's a good paper and I think it should be included in the conference and imagine that an interesting discussion about the value of these kind of tools for teachers would take place.", "type": "status", "id": "603441966384100_619734194754877"}
