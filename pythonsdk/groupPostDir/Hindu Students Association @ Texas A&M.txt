A series of anti-reservation protests (Anti-quota) was going on pan-India. We talked about caste/religion- based reservation and discrimination.\r\n\r\nHe said: \"On a global perspective and in an international platform, our country gets a good name and reputation when we protect and support minorities...\"\r\n\r\n\"That's why you give Haj subsidy (= is an airfare subsidy given to Indian Muslim Hajj pilgrims)?\u201d\r\n\r\n\"Yes- because we care for the minority\"\r\n\r\n\"In that case, Christians and Jews are also minorities in India. Why don't you provide subsidy for Christians for pilgrimage to Bethlehem?\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't have answer. I said: \"I don't think you love or care for minorities. You just want to appease Muslims...\"\r\n\r\n\"That, all political parties do...\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir, please NO politics. I am coming back from Malaysia. All government jobs and benefits will go to the majority community - Malay Muslims. Minority - Hindus that reduced to just 5% of the population now - is told to just get lost. Nobody cares for minority there. Still Malaysia has been recognized in the international platform - may be a step ahead than India...\" I said.\r\n\r\n\"You mean to say we shouldn't support Minority...\"\r\n\r\n\"We SHOULD, but there should be criteria for it... Why don't you support Minorities in Kashmir and East Indian states?  I belong to linguistic minority community, why don't you support us?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mixing up issues. Your ancestors - Brahmins - were once ruling class...\"\r\n\r\n\"False...we historically dedicated our lives for the sake of Dharma and welfare of the society. I can easily prove that all allegations against Brahmins are false...\" (Ref: Please Stop Brahmin bashing at  http://udaypai.in/?p=12 )\r\n\r\n\"So what should, according to you, be the criteria? Sympathy factor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Then my community has a stronger case. When St. Francis Xavier had persecuted more than 4 lakhs GSBs (who refused to get converted) in Goa, our ancestors lost everything and fled to Kerala and Karnataka. Another branch of our ancestors - Sarawats or Pundits - lost their mother-land in Kashmir. Don't you have any sympathy? At least, can't you provide merit based selection to us? NO ! But, I am not asking for any reservation or quota for my community...\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what should be the criteria?\"\r\n\r\n\"Our land\"\r\n\r\n\"What?\"\r\n\r\n\"See, we can live without caste, religion, politics, cinema, sports or international platform. But we need to eat food. We need to drink water. So reservation should be given to those patriots who believe that this is my mother land. Reservation, subsidy and support should only be limited to farmers or laborers on land. That is, real farmers who work in the agricultural land or farmland and NOT for planters or cash-crop producers. Please go to the villages and see the struggling poor farmers.\" I said.

Fact of the matter is, poor Hindu  does not know  how to answer any  question concerning his/her culture or religion. \n\nHe cannot even answer  a simple question such as What is the Hindu Concept of  God? That is the reason why he is running away from answering any question. \n\nSo we have to learn, how to answer  questions concerning our beliefs, when ever some one asks  us. We cannot and we should not run away from answering questions regarding our culture & beliefs...Apathy on our part is deplorable. \n\n \n\nI firmly believe in the saying\n\n \"All that is needed for the  evil to triumph is that good people do nothing.\"\n\n If we do not study and answer questions concerning us, someone else, who is an alien to our culture will define & explain  \u2018what our culture is all about\u2019  and propagate their version of Hinduism all over the world.  \n \nJust Google the  question  \u201cWhat  Do  Hindus  Believe?\u201d and you will be surprised to see all those who are explaining what Hinduism is all about are those who have nothing to do with Hinduism.  \n \n \n\nIf we do not define or explain  our culture and religion, some one else will  explain  it for the world\u2026Sad, but true.\n\n When we see false details of culture and beliefs spreading all over internet and among media,  we have nobody to blame except ours self.  When  we keep our mouth shut this is the result we will always get. \n\n \n\n So my advice to every one is to study all about our  culture first and then boldly answer any question with a smile on your face. \n\n Hindus have nothing to fear, except fear itself.\n\n \n\nhttp://edviswanathan.sulekha.com/blog/post/2009/08/what-do-hindus-believe.htm", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "2201983398_10150939154203399", "description": "What Do Hindus Believe? - What Do Hindus Believe?
