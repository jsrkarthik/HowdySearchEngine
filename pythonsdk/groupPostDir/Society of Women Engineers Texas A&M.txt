This year the topic is about \"Discovery, Collaboration, and Innovation\". We would like to invite you to this panel; to discuss how to establish collaborative interdisciplinary projects. We are hoping this panel will help students gain design and communication experience for projects which they will commonly undergo in industry and research.  After the panel we are going to have a speed networking session for faculty, postdocs, and students from different departments.\n\nThe panel will be held in Emerging Technologies Building (ETB)1034 Wednesday April 17th at 7:30 pm. For directions to ETB you can go to the link http://engineering.tamu.edu/biomedical/about/maps.\n\nFood and drinks will be provided.

Voting ends on Tomorrow at 12pm and it is a close competition so far! \n\nThanks to anyone who can help!", "type": "status", "id": "115739945192629_151149688318321", "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTUxMTk5MzI4MzEzMzU3", "before": "MTUxMTkxNTMxNjQ3NDcw"}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "628974085", "name": "Lauren Lauher"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2011-11-23T04:08:46+0000", "message": "I signed up to vote but it looks like only individuals employed by the government can vote for these essays.", "id": "151191531647470", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "409316", "name": "Laura Hill"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2011-11-23T04:44:47+0000", "message": "it is open to anyone...when you fill out the information you can just put \"student\" as current title and \"Texas A&M\" as current agency or organization. and type of government can be \"other\".
