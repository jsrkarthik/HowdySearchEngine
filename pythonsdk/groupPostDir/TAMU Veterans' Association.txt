YOUR INPUT WILL REALLY HELP!!!!\n*************************\n\nHowdy Texas A&M students:\n \nAs students at this university, we each contribute to the growth and development of Texas A&M through student fees. The Student Affairs Fee Advisory Board Sub-Council (SAFAB) is charged with making recommendations on funds related to out-of-class experiences directly related to students. Because the nine board members of SAFAB recognize the value of such experiences to students, we ask that you provide input on the current requests.\n \nRequests have come from a variety of departments within Student Affairs and pertain to a range of issues, including new positions and programming. SAFAB has worked diligently over the past few weeks to review requests and departmental budgets. We are now seeking maximum student feedback on submitted proposals. Please visit http://safab.tamu.edu/proposals/2015 by October 23rd and comment on submissions made by various departments.\n \nAfter SAFAB concludes its review process and receives input from the student body, the Graduate Student Council, and the Student Senate, our recommendations will be forwarded to the Council for Strategic Budgeting. We hope that you will take a moment to provide your input, as the decisions being made will have significant impact on both the quality of opportunities available and their affordability to all students.\n \nIf you have any questions regarding SAFAB or the fee process, please feel free to visit our website safab.tamu.edu or to contact me directly.\n \n \nThank you,\n \nNahua Kang\nChair\nStudent Affairs Fee Advisory Board\nkangnahua@tamu.edu", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "2201854238_10151982960384239", "description": "Thank you for visiting the SAFAB FY2015 Proposals webpage.

His leadership, commitment to student veterans, and dedication are the trademark characteristics of this generation's servicemen and women. Not only has Mr. Dakduk developed countless relationships with many of you, but he has empowered SVA to become a premier organization supporting today's student veterans and for that we are deeply appreciative. \n \nWe are also pleased to introduce our new Executive Director, Mr. D. Wayne Robinson, a former Command Sergeant Major of the U.S. Army. In addition to years of military leadership, Mr. Robinson also brings savvy business acumen to SVA. He previously served as partner and head of new business development at Drexel Hamilton Investment Partners, a Wall-Street investment firm, and earned an MBA from the world-renowned Booth School of Business at the University of Chicago. \n \nMr. Robinson is extremely passionate about education and looks forward to working with each of you. You can read his full bio here. \n \nWe are also fortunate to have an exceptional staff that will ensure no momentum is lost during the transition. The quality of our programs, our extraordinary partnership, and the collaborative spirit of our chapters will continue to drive our success for decades to come. With several major initiatives in the works for 2014 and beyond, we're excited to continue working with all of your to empower student veterans to lead the next great wave of American progress!

We have evolved into a Service that carries out missions through air, space and cyberspace, but our core missions have remained constant.  Advances in technology now allow us to fly faster, farther and higher than ever before.  We use aircraft and spacecraft that no one could have imagined at our Service\u2019s creation, and we continue to provide an asymmetric advantage for America. \n\nAirmen have been and continue to be the strength of our Service.  The U.S. Air Force was forged by airpower legends with names like Sijan, Levitow, Jones and Day.  These heroes and many others made history, and their legacy continues as today\u2019s Airmen write the history of this generation.  Decades from now, the names of Airmen among us today will be as familiar as the names of the earlier heroes we celebrate. \n\nAmerica depends on the Airmen who provide Global Vigilance, Global Reach and Global Power, and our remarkable Total Force of Active Duty, Guard, Reserve and Civilian Airmen has never failed to answer the Nation\u2019s call.  Please join us in proudly celebrating the 66th birthday of the U.S. Air Force.  As always, we sincerely thank you and your families for all that you do.\n\nHappy Birthday, Air Force!", "type": "status", "id": "2201854238_10151937726934239", "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTE5Mzc4OTY5OTQyMzk=", "before": "MTAxNTE5Mzc4OTY5OTQyMzk="}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "518516120", "name": "Joe Cook"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-09-18T13:48:06+0000", "message": "Air Power", "id": "10151937896994239", "user_likes": false}]}}

Eddie has been walking for the past five years and fully expects to walk for at least five more years \u2013 totaling well over 12,000 miles.\nEddie started his trip by heading to Washington state and then down the West Coast. Along the way, he visited veteran hospitals and veteran organizations in an effort to raise awareness of veteran healthcare and veteran rights. He has been invited to speak to troops stationed at bases along his route, like during his visit to Camp Pendleton.\nOn his way to the East Coast, Eddie reached his 5,000-mile mark in Paige, Texas (about halfway between Bastrop and Giddings). \nHis walk has not been without hardship. Eddie has suffered from trench-foot like injuries, wild animal attacks, and even side-swipes from passing vehicles. At one point during his trip, Eddie was locked inside a cemetery while he was paying respects to all the Native American veterans buried there. \nAveraging twenty miles a day, Eddie walks his way in hopes of meeting veterans, mayors, governors, school children, law enforcement, and other ordinary Americans.\nEddie arrived in the Bryan/College Station area a couple of days ago and has been a guest in the home of a couple of Marines from our Marine Corps League detachment.\nRED STAR CLUSTER\nWe are seeking other local Marines or veterans that can host Eddie during his stay in our area. He will need lodging starting Tuesday afternoon, and he plans to stay until Friday morning \u2013 after which he will depart for Huntsville.\nIf you can host Eddie (or know someone that can) please contact Maggie McGuire at (979) 204-4737.", "type": "status", "id": "2201854238_10151738838539239", "comments": {"paging": {"cursors": {"after": "MTAxNTE3NDEwMTMzMTkyMzk=", "before": "MTAxNTE3Mzk5NzI5MDkyMzk="}}, "data": [{"from": {"id": "500049373", "name": "Erik Christman"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-07-10T00:29:42+0000", "message": "Which Tuesday?

They make up the driving team and represent uRide to every person who uses the service.  \n\nWhy student veterans?\nuRide is veteran owned and operated.  Our CEO served in the Air Force (alongside our CTO), and put himself through college driving a taxi.  He saw it as the perfect job \u2013 high pay and time to study between fares \u2013 and wanted to pass this same opportunity to other student veterans.  uRide benefits by being represented by professionals.  We  promote reliability, safety, and world class service \u2013 all values personified by US military veterans! \n\nWhy should I drive for uRide? \nuRide offers high pay, the ability to study during work, and unbeatable training in customer service.\n\nHow does it work?\nuRide runs on an independent contractor system.  We run the cars in shifts, with each shift belonging to one driver.  He leases the car per shift, and keeps all fares and tips earned.  \n\nuRide hopes this is as appealing a partnership for student veterans as it is for us.

These immediate openings begin in May and provide expense-paid career training opportunities. Please pass this information along to anyone you think might be interested in this unique opportunity. \n \nThe Veterans Fire Corps will be comprised of veterans receiving essential training, credentials and experience to competitively pursue wild land fire and forestry careers. Participants will work in teams of five with an experienced SCA Project Leader.  Projects may include, but are not limited to, participation on prescribed fires, fuels reduction, fire effects monitoring, FIREWISE educational outreach and pre-fire preparation of burn units.  Members will serve in National Forests in South Dakota, Colorado and Wyoming. Begins Monday, May 20, 2013. \n \nThe Veterans Historic Preservation Corps will engage US military veterans in historic preservation work with the US Forest Service. Veterans will broaden their military skills while learning historic preservation techniques to include carpentry, roofing, log work, masonry and other trades skills that they will be able to apply to their personal and professional lives. Over the course of 12 weeks these skills will be developed under the supervision and direction of HistoriCorps staff. Begins Monday, May 13, 2013.\n \nFor these US military veterans-specific programs, members must be in good physical condition and willing and able to live and work in all weather conditions. All tools and camping gear will be provided with the exception of personal items. In addition to transportation to and from the internship locations members will receive a weekly living allowance and be eligible for an AmeriCorps education award. A DD Form 214 is required as evidence of an Honorable discharge or General under Honorable conditions on a case by case basis.\n \nMilitary veterans may also be interested in the Army Corps of Engineers Visitor Use Survey Program. This SCA partnership provides members a valuable and enjoyable opportunity to help the Army Corps of Engineers monitor the use of its beautiful recreational sites across the country.  Participants in this program will work in teams of five members, supervised by one Project Leader, stationed in a location central to the sites the team is tasked with monitoring. Members, in pairs, will collect recreation use information from visitors, primarily through roadside interviews. The interview sites include lakes and other recreation areas. Teamwork will be a key to success in travel logistics, travelling to survey sites and implementing a safe and effective plan. Begins Friday, May 17, 2013. \n \nIf you have any questions about these positions and opportunities for US Military Veterans with SCA, and to have your application fee waived, please send us an email to SCArecruiting@thesca.org.

If you are looking for work, they have the resources to help, to include paying for your gas as you job search, among other things. \n\nEven if you are not looking for a job, like myself at the moment, they will still give you a free voucher to take free online (on your own time and you can complete whenever you want) classes to get your Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office Certifications. The voucher also pays for a Test-Prep, and the test itself. You first get a voucher for the intermediate certification, and when you complete that they will give you one for the advanced certification as well. Ms. Mefford said we would only have to pay the proctor fee, but I contacted Avonex on University Drive, the local proctoring office (979-846-9727) and Zach informed me that the proctoring is free as well with the voucher.\n\nYou can contact Ms. Mefford at 979-595-2801 ext. 2104.

A small group of veterans of the intense, hard-fought battle are organizing a reunion at the National Museum of the Marine Corps in Quantico, Virginia to commemorate the occasion and they need your help. \n\n\"We are looking across the nation for fellow veterans of the Battle of An-Nasiriyah and Task Force Tarawa - the Marine Corps and Naval Units involved in the battle,\" says Dion Brugger, Marine Iraq War Veteran. \"If anyone was or knows a Marine who was at An Nasiriyah, please have them visit the reunion website at www.tftreunion.org and register for the event, even if they don't know how they\u2019re going to get there yet. We're working on getting sponsors to help with that.\" You can also receive additional information about the reunion at www.tftreunon.org.\n\nOf the 7,100 US Marines and Sailors of Task Force Tarawa, We hope that between 300 to 500 Marines and Sailors will gather on March 23rd in Quantico, Virginia to commemorate the occasion - together. Reunion attendees can also visit Arlington National Cemetery and buildings on the United States Marine Corps Base at Quantico named in Marines killed in the battle - They will meet authors who wrote books on the battle and share artifacts, photographs, and memories.\n\nOrganizers are also seeking sponsors for the event to offset the costs born by the Iraq War Veterans attending the reunion. Sponsor dollars will go to pay for the evening social at the Museum, bus transportation, and even to help offset the travel costs of those veterans who could otherwise not afford to travel to the reunion. \n\nTo help support the reunion, please visit the reunion website at www.tftreunion.org or contact Mr. Brugger by email TFTReunion@gmail.com.\n\nThe 2nd Marine Division was called to duty while on New Years leave January 3rd, 2003. By Jan 15th, 2003 the 2nd Marine Expeditionary Brigade, to become known as \"Task Force Tarawa\" had boarded seven ships and was sailing towards the Persian Gulf.\n\nThis is one of the sharpest engagements of the Iraq War. \nThe rest of Task Force Tarawa's story is provided in some of news articles collected on our reunion website...http://www.tftreunion.org/Our_History_in_the_News.php . In addition there are at least seven books have been written about the Battle of An Nasiriyah and the Marines of Task Force Tarawa.\n\n-Semper Fi-\n\nDion Brugger\ntftreunion@gmail.com\nhttps://www.facebook.com/TFTReunion", "type": "status", "id": "2201854238_10151367604084239"}

Went into the MSC today to see the renovations (I was in Bryan for business).  Checked out the flags.  Both plaques for the 5 service flags were not up and also the POW/MIA plaque.  Spoke to Sherry Wine, Director of the University Center Complex and she immediately contacted maintenance, located the plaques and was able to commit to having them re-placed in the flag room asap.  \n\nThe flags are now framed and the lighting will be adjusted to showcase them as the lights are off a bit now due to the fact that the flags were not hung at the same height.  The frames cost $1200 a piece!  That's more than the flags cost and they really are showcased properly and look like they belong there.\n\nReally enjoyed the sight seeing and saw the new office for veterans.  You guys may want to keep an eye out for those plaques and if they are not in a few weeks, contact Sherry to make certain that they are still on her mind.\n\nHope the organization is doing well.  You should consider having some sort of event where past members may be able to visit?  Could be a great opportunity for networking.  Just food for thought.\n\nHave a great summer!", "type": "status", "id": "2201854238_10150932019654239"}

Academics, Student Services, Veteran Affairs, Programming, Recruiting, Outreach, Tuition Costs vs. Benefits, Comparisons to outside Universities, Faculty and Staff Input and a variety of other things... This document when completed will be the framework for how Texas A&M handles its veteran affairs on the student side and you better believe we are working closely with staff members across the University, so that on May 1st when we publish our final report, changes will be made in order to better serve veteran's here at Texas A&M.  We have two veterans who were elected this year in the Student Government who will be writing student legislation on these issues and they are supported by the heavy majority of student senators and student government officials.\n\nVets - This is your chance to be heard.  We have already identified several issues based solely upon Texas A&M's own system documentation on best practices for veterans in college, but we could have missed something.  Take some time to write down any issues you have on campus: academics, advising, counseling, accessibility, ANYTHING and let us know.  You can email it myself @ taylor.sessions@tamu.edu, or you can take it up to the Veteran Services Office and drop it off with one of the student workers up there who can get it to either myself or Tim. You don\u2019t have to put your name on it and you don\u2019t have to identify yourself in any way, it can be completely anonymous but we NEED your input on this.\n\nIf you want to get involved, now is the time.  We are opening our new office in the MSC in April, we have grant applications in that need handling, we are writing more applications for outside sponsorships and aid, we have a heavy advocating section that is gaining massive traction across campus, we are working to partner with other student organizations on campus for service projects and have already successfully done so with the Corps of Cadets and we are also in the process of establishing contacts outside the University with various groups including the VFW, American Legion, USO, IAVA and Wounded Warriors.\n\nIf you have any other questions or considerations on how to get involved, please email me again at: taylor.sessions@tamu.edu, or come to the next Veteran Association meeting at General Weber\u2019s house on March 19th at 6:00 pm or 1800 hours, however you choose to still look at time!

Few have given more to our Nation than the men and women who have served in our Armed Forces in peace and in war. \n\nGeneration after generation\u2014from Bunker Hill and Bennington to Baghdad and Abbottabad\u2014protected, defended, and preserved the principles and ideals that define our democracy. Across that remarkable sweep of history, today\u2019s America was shaped at Lexington and Concord, Antietam and Gettysburg, in the skies over Midway, on the beaches of Normandy, in winter\u2019s grip at Chosin Reservoir, in the heat of Ia Drang Valley, from the Persian Gulf into Afghanistan and Iraq by those who wore our Nation\u2019s uniforms. Over twenty-two million living Veterans today embody our exceptional character and values as a people\u2014each a line in our Nation\u2019s history, but together many chapters towards today\u2019s future. \n\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs fulfills its obligation to serve Veterans, their families, and survivors of the fallen by living a set of core values defining who we are as an organization: Integrity, Commitment, Advocacy, Respect, and Excellence\u2014I CARE. Veterans trust that we will live these values, every day, in our medical facilities, our benefits offices, and our national cemeteries. And VA is committed to serving them. We are privileged to provide the very best in compassionate and quality care and services, delivered by our more than 300,000 employees. \n\nAs we honor and celebrate the contributions of all of our Nation\u2019s Veterans, we take special pride in those Veterans who work here at VA\u2014over 100,000 of us\u2014bringing to our mission the skills, knowledge, attributes, experiences, and unwavering commitment to the well-being of our fellow Veterans. Take a moment and visit VA\u2019s Flicker site to see our photographs and snapshots from earlier times in uniform. You can access those photos today at: http://www.flickr.com/photos/VeteransAffairs/sets/72157627830104759/\n\nI am privileged to join all my VA colleagues in saluting the service and honoring the sacrifices of the special men and women who walk the halls of our hospitals and clinics, offices and Vet Centers each day. God bless our Veterans. And may God continue to bless this wonderful country of ours.\n\n                                                      Eric K.
