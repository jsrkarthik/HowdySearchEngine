Please read below. I added a later message too where an address and drop off point were mentioned. Gig 'em. \n\nHello my Aggie Brothers and Sisters,\n \nI have a neighbor whose daughter was recently accepted into Texas A&M.  She is a transfer student and begins class this Monday.  This is an amazing accomplishment for Courtney and well deserved.  Having weathered her parent's difficult divorce and  financial difficulty we are thrilled that Courtney has an opportunity to attend college - and are OVERJOYED that it is TEXAS A&M.  She has always kept a positive outlook and has persisted through thick and thin.\n \nWe attended a little send off for her last night as she loaded her car and her mother's van, and prayed for their safe journey to College Station.  Unfortunately one vehicle broke down on Highway 6 and Courtney pulled off the road and parked in front of it.  She grabbed her dogs and at her mother's urging vacated the vehicle.  Minutes later both autos were hit by an 18 wheeler and totaled.  We are so grateful that Debbie and Courtney are safe, and know that things and cars can be replaced.  It's just so unfortunate that they lost both cars and all of their contents.  Courtney will be renting an apartment and had scraped together furniture, a computer, clothes, school supplies, a tv etc. all were lost in the accident, and it will be a challenge to replace it.\n \nI am hoping the Aggie network can assist this family in some way as they regroup and pull things together.  Even if it's just words of encouragement, and a contact or two in College Station, it woudl be greatly appreciated.  Courtney was able to attend orientation this morning and is a first generation Aggie. Debbie, her mom, does not quite understand the Aggie Spirit.   I'd love to give her a first hand experience of how we take care of our own.\n \nDoes anyone know if we have a hotline for \"Aggie Emergencies\" or a phone tree?  Does anyone have any thoughts or suggestions?  Please email me if you would like to help.\n \nThank you!\nBeth Lopez\nClass Agent '87\n\nWe are working to set up an account in College Station..... In the mean time-  Rather than publish her apartment info. Folks can send cards to me at 8621 Amhurst ct,\nN Richland Hills, TX 76182 I will record and forward these to her.\n\nOr drop off cards/contributions at The Association of Former Students for Courtney Barnett care of Kathryn Greenwade.  Courtney can pick them up there.\n\nThank you so much for your kindness!\nI look forward to providing a positive report soon!!!", "type": "status", "id": "5987811811_10151361066821812"}
