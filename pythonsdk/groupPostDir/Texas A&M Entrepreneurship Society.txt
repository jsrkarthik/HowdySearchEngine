Parcel pickup kiosk operator BufferBox Inc. is moving on up to Google Inc. after being acquired by the huge tech firm. That\u2019s because home base for the student venture is the VeloCity Garage inside the Communitech Hub startup incubator, located in the famed Lang Tannery building in the warehouse district \u2014 downstairs from Google\u2019s regional office.\n\nWe\u2019re really excited to be able to build out that vision quite a bit quicker than we otherwise would have without them on side. On Friday, Google announced it has acquired the not-quite-two-year-old startup for an undisclosed sum, which means the team at BufferBox will be moving their operations up a flight of stairs to join the Google team on the upper floor of the building. While the physical move will be a short one for BufferBox, the trio of University of Waterloo graduates who created the company are hoping to leverage Google\u2019s considerable resources to quickly scale their business and change the way people think about e-commerce and shipping packages.\n\nBufferBox announced last month it had reached a deal with Metrolinx to roll out its self-serve parcel pickup kiosks to GO Transit stations, including Toronto\u2019s Union Station. The company aims to have 100 BufferBoxes installed in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton area by the end of 2013. In addition to transit hubs, the company is also working on agreements with grocery and convenience stores.\n\nThe company \u2014 which graduated from Silicon Valley\u2019s Y Combinator accelerator program this summer \u2014 is offering the service for free this year to help build up a user base. Eventually the company plans to charge $3 or $4 per package delivered to its boxes. Google Waterloo engineering director Steve Woods said the BufferBox team \u2014 which consists of seven employees beyond its trio of founders \u2014 will be kept intact, with Google providing additional resources to help the company grow.", "type": "status", "id": "56022147184_10151012071607185"}

Will also created one for the Aggie Angel Network, which you can find on AAN's FB page too. Will has been to AAN meetings, which are open to paid student members of eSociety. He offered earlier this semester to create a custom Aggie QR code for any A&M student organization or student startup affiliated with Startup Aggieland at half-price. Will's Aggie-owned and operated company offers a free QR Code Generator but only charges $9.95 to create a color, logo'd QR Code, so at half-price...that's more than affordable for eSociety or any of the student startups at Startup Aggieland. The cool thing about Will's QR Codes are first-- they work every time; and secondly, they can be Aggiefied; and thirdly, they collect metrics or data. Ours was the first of its kind in Aggieland! We have had NO complaints with our QR Codes. The Aggie Angel Network's custom QR Code and Startup Aggieland's custom QR Code both point to their FB pages, but can be set to point to your whatever. They work perfectly, so well that we received a mandate from A&M's Assistant VP Research to use Will's custom QR Code for Startup Aggieland on everything we produce for marketing! Sadly, there was a missed opportunity to use our custom QR Code on t-shirts for the Leave Your Legacy campaign, but you can even put an eSociety custom Aggie QR Code on your t-shirts after your t-shirt design contest deadlines on Oct. 16th!

Great idea, Kyle Douglas! May I suggest contacting Khang Tran-- president of Leaders in Creativity. Here is his email: khangtran09@tamu.edu. They share the large office in Startup Aggieland for eSociety and LIC. (When are you guys moving in? You have a designated desk and tall file cabinet... and Julian Tagle has his own hatrack!) Also, you could contact Lynn Hagen with Women's Former Student Network. She is a member of this group and has offered free mentoring resources from the Aggie Women affiliate of the Association of Former Students. Another great student organization to involve is the A&M Chapter of American Business Women's Association (ABWA), whose president is friends with Julian. She worked with Julian over the summer on eSociety and is on our Student Leadership Council (SLC) at the Startup. Two groups I belong to on campus might also be good partners in a joint ventured program for eSociety-- the A&M student chapter of Financial Management Association (adviser is Sally Guyton); and one that I am an officer with-- Aggies In Themed Attractions Design, whose president is Cardin Menkemeller. Cardin went to MSC Fall Leadership Conference with Julian and about 13 other Startup Aggieland FLC Delegates. The more you guys interact with other student organizations-- which was the focus of FLC-- the more word gets out about who you are and how great your group is! it's all about \"shared programming\"! I suggest looking into inviting 12th Man Student Foundation out one time-- get them to bring their student athletes from the Men's Basketball Team and Aggie Football Team who are interested in entrepreneurship, like Cody Daniels-- one of our EIRs who founded Sports Cry LLC (see their website and facebook pages), who is a student manger of the Men's Basketball Team; and SEC record-setter returner Dustin Harris, who helped us set up the accelerator's furniture this summer. He wants to launch a startup that makes animal traps and other hunting equipment. Getting some woman entrepreneurs to speak, recruiting some young women from other organizations to share a program with eSociety and maybe bringing in some cool student-athlete entrepreneurs... now THAT would be some different twists on what you've been doing with eSociety to promote student entrepreneurship! (I still think you guys should organize an eSociety Delegation to go on that chartered bus trip to Louisiana with the 12th Man Student Foundation. If 5 or 6 or 10 of you guys went on the bus, you could recruit members and talk up eSociety, plan some type of joint program and just have some fun as a group! For $85pp, you get a game ticket, hotel room and transportation!) Keep up the fantastic marketing, Kyle! You and the other officers are having a great year so far!!! http://www.facebook.com/groups/142239809132333/http://www.facebook.com/groups/400152676707817/", "id": "10150949740572185", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "561549854", "name": "Kyle Douglas"}, "message_tags": [{"length": 12, "offset": 120, "type": "user", "id": "720574505", "name": "Julian Tagle"}], "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-10-06T20:00:49+0000", "message": "We have our next few meetings planned out already, but I'm sure we can find a way to fit this into the schedule.

How are you? Can you believe the summer got by us and we never went to lunch or got together?! I don't know about an open house, but the door is always open for you! Yesterday, I think Don Lewis and Dr. Richard Lester said the MGMT 489 students are planning something or possibly Taylor Vestal is organizing this. We all sort of have things we are working on and an open house isn't something that I've been working on. My projects are a grant and the new website for our facility. We will have a cool, new website up soon that's being designed right now by the way cool guys at Drifting Creatives! They are having professional photos made of our student startup founders so they can be featured on the home page! I'm very excited about Drifting Creatives' design work because it is fresh and a little edgy. They are nationally known and specialize in college marketing. We just got the wire frames yesterday and they look awesome! Interactive and informative. If you can steal away from work sometime soon, Blake Petty is in the back office of the accelerator all day on Mon. and Fri., plus the afternoons of Wed. every week. He is interim director of the accelerator and splits his time between there and Dr. Jeff Seemann's office. I'm sure Blake would love to show you around. The rest of us are volunteers. We'll be open at night very soon so you can always drop by and get Julian Tagle or Mr. Lewis' new TA Andrew Karl to give you a personal tour! They will be spending a lot of time at the accelerator, especially after hours. Please let me know what you think.

Thanks! I've been online since 1984, starting with one of these and then using A&M's more powerful computers around 1985 or since before you were born. Back when the main searchable content was maintained by news services, research universities and legal databases. Few people I knew in the early 80s had heard of the Internet. A&M and UT offered public access (along with other universities in the Southwest), but the average person didn't know that. In 1987, Compaq reached one billion in annual sales faster than any other U.S. company in history. In 1989, I became friends with Jim Harris, the Aggie engineer who co-founded Compaq with Rod Canion and Bill Murto. He'd fallen off A&M's radar when he quit and transferred to U of H. He showed in A&M's alumni directory as whereabouts unknown. I was introduced to Compaq by my brother-in-law, an early adopter of their portable IBM clone. He would get stopped in airports by people wanting to see his Compaq's game-changing suitcase-style PC, which weighed around 30 lbs. I remember Rod told me that they used to make sales by tossing the computer case down an office building's hallway-- then opening it up to show that it still booted. The thing was built like a tank. When I wrote a feature story about Jim for a national magazine, A&M called and called me for his private number (which took me a year to get.) Jim finally gave me permission to give his number out and A&M invited him that year as commencement speaker -- running my article about Jim in the former students magazine. Not long after that, Bill left Compaq for the ministry and Jim left Compaq a year or two later. Back then, businessmen and academics used the Internet, not 9 year olds and  grandmas. It's pretty amazing how far its come. Libraries are reinventing themselves, the post office is obsolete and our world is now flat. By the way, Bill attended The University of Texas as an undergrad and graduate student, before joining Texas Instruments. http://oldcomputers.net/compaqi.html", "id": "10150790893287185", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "1409854875", "name": "Shelly Brenckman"}, "message_tags": [{"length": 12, "offset": 0, "type": "user", "id": "778658764", "name": "Nick Spiller"}], "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-06-27T13:11:37+0000", "message": "Nick Spiller - If you want to know about a great American start-up, featuring both Bill and Jim, check out this video series: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3qI5kAjh4M&feature=player_embedded#!", "id": "10150790897592185", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "1409854875", "name": "Shelly Brenckman"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-06-27T13:59:02+0000", "message": "Hey Nick, besides Bill Murto, you should add another great UT grad to your list of successful UT entrepreneurs.

Don't over think it! Texas A&M does NOT take an equity position in any student start-ups launched at the student business accelerator or otherwise hold an ownership position over patents and intellectual property. This is an experiential education project or hands-on learning/leadership environment intended to provide currently-enrolled A&M students with easy access to A&M resources and private funding so students may develop their for-profit or non-profit business ideas (if they want). We also will offer purely social access for students and/or members of eSociety  who just want to be part of something fun or help mentor other student entrepreneurs. The main purpose is cross-college collaboration so that students can meet other students with the same interest in entrepreneurship, innovation and creativity. Anyone can join the student business accelerator but not everyone can access an office. We have an application process for access to dedicated and furnished office space, as well as to timeshare offices and co-working spaces (also called Hot Desks at some co-working spaces). We offer large and small furnished conference rooms, a full kitchen, a library, collaboration room, tinker room and other cool features for student-use only. The student business accelerator will offer workshops, access to preferred professional providers and stage  special events. We are talking with UT's version to see if we can organize a trip to Geekdom in San Antonio or a weekend at an \"Entrepreneurship Dude Ranch\" there. UT's Nick Spiller has offered to host a pool party for A&M student entrepreneurs. UT has also suggested a golf tournament or basketball game between our schools. Be thinking of what fun things you'd like to see us offer and let eSociety President Julian Tagle know so he can bring it up in the incubator class next week. The student business accelerator is like Ideas Challenge...only meant to support students and hook them up with mentors who might fund their ideas. If you're super interested, register for MGMT 489 next fall to be part of the launch team for A&M's student business accelerator! Don Lewis is the instructor and a cool guy. We have lots of fun in class and he feeds us really well! Last spring, he hosted a pool party at his home for our class and a sister class in the College of Architecture.

A 24-7-365 operation, there is a great \"blue room\" with a fuSonny guy named Wayne. His job is to monitor internet buzz, where Dell is trending and the amplification of Dell's brand. For example, Texas is shown on the global map as bright red but Iceland is a pale yellow. Bloggers who post about Dell-- demoters and promoters float-- some have small icons while others have larger ones to indicate who has the most influence. It's an agile mapping system so bloggers are constantly fluctuating, getting larger or smaller and disappearing. Michael Dell, founder of Dell Inc., had a lower global impact but Dell overall had a larger impact. By having staff interact with consumers or potential customers via social media, Dell is more proactive.

I have been the Chegg.com Brand Ambassador for Texas A&M University with Clinton (my husband now) for the past 2 years. We are graduated and have full-time jobs so they want to find 2 new people and they asked for my help. Basically, we need easy easy promotion stuff at the beginning and end of each year with textbooks for a lot of extra side money.\n\nThis weekend they need the 2 new people ASAP for textbook buybacks. You have to be available Friday, Saturday, and Sunday. You get $500 just for promoting Chegg.com and coordinating/working a table with Chegg.com representatives coming in on their huge fun tour bus. You need to get coordinate to get the tour bus somewhere where a lot of students are. You also hand out fliers and promote on Facebook.\n\nOk this is where commission comes in. If you get 1000 books sold to Chegg in those three days, you get an extra $1000. If you get 1600 books sold to Chegg in those three days, you get $1500. If you get 2000 books sold to Chegg in those three days, you get $1800. This is for the two people working it so you split it.\n\nIf you do this and do a decent job, you will probably be the next Chegg.com Brand Ambassadors at Texas A&M if you are graduating right away. Lots of extra cash and really easy stuff.\n\nIt is for this weekend (and of course promoting before so you get the books sold back) so if you are interested let me know ASAP! I am trying to help her out to find 2 new people.\n\nThanks!

It is the Phase II (Implementation) course that builds on a Phase I course (Business Plan) offered this spring. Students need to let Don Lewis in the Management Dept. know if they are interested asap. He invites those students that contribute something to the \"Launch Team\" for The Startup. This semester's class collaborated with a sister class in the College of Architecture. ARCH 485 was led by Rodney Hill. Those students designed an architectural space plan and custom furniture, including a conference table and ceiling installation to personalize the facility and make it more user-friendly. The concept is to provide an innovation hub for students of all majors, all levels of study, to collaborate on creative ideas and business startups. The Startup is for students only. Professional mentors from the business community will help students form boards of experienced CEOs, bankers, etc. around their business concepts if feasible and help them get seed funding. There are a limited number of offices for student \"Entrepreneurs in Residence\" but for those who are just starting out and don't yet have a business with customers, they can timeshare an office that gets them access to free office supplies, meeting space, the kitchen, conference room, prototyping facility and benefits of membership. The class this summer will go visit another campus business incubator and help get The Startup operating for a soft opening in the fall, to be followed by a grand opening and ribbon-cutting during a beta launch.
