Legal recognition of a relationship is important for a myriad of reasons, including but not limited to: insurance coverage, estate planning, visitation rights, federal benefits like veterans' benefits, bereavement leave... There are over a thousand provisions in the US where martial status has an effect on rights, benefits, etc. I'd rather not seek out stories of awful consequences when peoples' relationships are not codified, but they are out there. (Especially prevalent in the LGBT* community.)\n\nNow, whether those things should be afforded at all is a different matter. In some cases I think it would inconceivable to suggest that the government should not provide for certain things. Visitation rights, medical decisions, after death arrangements all come to mind. Are these things that could be easily filed under the purview of \"civil unions?\" Probably.\n\nI guess I'm mainly restating that which has been said before; namely, that marriage ought to be relegated to the ceremony, and civil union to take its place as the legal idea. But, people are very fond of their ceremonies, and for good reason in some cases. Ceremonies help tie together culture.

However, without an actual GOOD philosopher like Shelly Kagan there, which would make the event worthwhile.\n\nAlso what does it matter that craig has \u201ca hundred peer reviewed articles\u201d. Saul Kripke hasn't published much work, only one book, but is considered THE greatest living analytic philosopher. Also Wittgenstein only published one article and only the tractatus while living. So would you say that Craig is a better philosopher for having more volume than two people who changed the field with only a few articles.\n\nAnother note is where did Craig publish, was it philosophical review, nous, mind, synthese, or did he publish in none of the top philosophical journals, because from what I am aware of all Craig has published in is journals of philosophy of religion, and if he has published in a top journal it pales in comparison to his contributions to lesser journals. \n\nLook, I do philosophy, I want it to be my profession, in my opinion what this man does is not serious philosophy and he shouldn't be taken seriously.", "id": "10151301293801786", "user_likes": false}]}}

As a pragmatist, I realize that the pursuit of knowledge and experience often requires the trading of money for the opportunity to learn and experience. When I attended TAMU and was trying to create/expand the then-absent philosophy club, we received no funding. I hope that situation has changed. If you still lack funds, then please accept this donation to your group. You may use it for ANY (as in UNRESTRICTED) purpose which you feel promotes the study and understanding of philosophy. I hope it helps.\n\nAs a side note: I traded part of my limited time here on earth for the little green pieces of paper which this check represents. Do not squander my life. Use it well and the improvement of your lives will justify my gift.\n\nThank you,\nLouis J. Needleman, M.D. (class of 1987)\"\n\nEnclosed was a check for one thousand dollars.\n\nDr. Needleman was the founder and first president of the Philosophy Club. He is listed in the \"Alumni Profiles\" section of the Philosophy Department website (http://philosophy.tamu.edu/Philosophy/Former_Students/alumni_profiles.html), and he lives in Corpus Christi and works as an Emergency Room Physician.\nHis gift is fantastic. He left a return address on the envelope this came in, and so the club officers will be sending him a thank you letter, along with an invitation to our meetings and an explanation of our funding (I feel obligated to offer him the return of the donation on that basis).\n\nI just thought that the entirety of the club should be given notice of this type of action and sentiment. As well, I disclose that the money will go towards extending our regular budget (i.e.- food, merchandise, trips, entrance fees), unless there's a suggestion on this post or in a meeting a sensible, respectful, and creative way to fulfill the requirements set forth by Dr. Needleman in the above letter.\n\nWelcome back everyone! Have a great start to the fall semester.", "type": "status", "id": "28603566785_10150271587996786"}
