One argument that our opponents will provide is that stressed out students commit suicide. Secondly, its not your Constitutional Right to carry on a university campus, it is your constitutional right to keep and bear arms in your home for a repelling of federal tyranny by the troops, something that would cause even me to walk away from the military. Additionally, it is not good form to walk to the table asking for privileges without offering compromise. What better way to further our argument by being able to say that our students with a CHL are also highly intelligent students who are educated, get good grades, and maintain good academic standing? Why would the school grant such a great responsibility to students who cannot handle college life itself? Let alone make them keepers of safety and diligence. Finally, having financial issues such as bankruptcy can prevent you from receiving a CHL even in a Shall Issue state.

If we are trusted in society, why are we not allowed to protect ourselves where we spend most of our time and where a threat would be most imminent? \nThe common misconception that approval for concealed carry on campus would raise the number of gun conflicts has been proven to be wrong in every state that has passed this! A person with criminal intention does not take the time to obtain a CHL prior to committing a crime, they simply act. And if those of us trained and/or licensed to protect ourselves and perhaps even prevent a mass casualty situation are disarmed in the place we frequent most, then why entrust us with this license at all? I will not support the continuation of your office held if you cannot take this into consideration and let the few of us that have gone through the lengthy process to protect ourselves do so.\n\nV/r,\nFC2(SW) Robert Barnett\nUSN\"", "id": "10151794331237589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "54101538", "name": "Eric AN"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2013-04-03T18:30:00+0000", "message": "any more updates", "id": "10151840212617589", "user_likes": false}]}}

As you may recall, the state Senate passed this legislation as a stand-alone bill in 2009 and as an amendment to a higher education bill in 2011.  During both sessions, the full state House of Representatives failed to even consider this measure.  During that time, high-profile shootings have occurred at the University of Texas at Austin and several blocks from the Texas A&M campus in College Station.  Both locations are classified as 'gun-free zones,' but in reality are simply places where CHLs are rendered defenseless against criminals under current law.\nWe need to build momentum for this issue in the House as public hearings begin on filed bills.

In that case, I would suggest considering a nightstand/car gun, or a long gun for home defense. A nightstand gun is a hand gun that's generally too large to easily conceal because it has a larger frame. Because of that, they're often a larger caliber or higher capacity gun that what you would normally carry on yourself. They're generally easier to shoot because of their larger size, and like the name implies, they're kept sitting in/on your nightstand in case things go bump in the night. They are also a good choice for carrying in your car, where you can conceal a bigger gun within easy reach. As far as a long gun, I don't think anyone would argue that a pump action shotgun or an AR-15 are bad choices. You're the one who will use it though, hopefully not needing to protect yourself, so it's ultimately your call on what you need and get.

From the title and tagline, I was willing to read it and give it as fair as a shot as I could, despite it obviously being at least somewhat anti-concealed carry.

RESPONSIBLE GUN OWNERSHIP, PEOPLE.\n\n2) If guns were to be allowed on campuses, they would be in the possession of people with concealed carry permits, who would never, EVER put a gun somewhere as public and unsafe as a backpack. Hell, I would probably feel nervous sitting next to someone with a gun in their backpack, but that is NOT where a concealed handgun is stored.\n\n3) If the author is so nervous about people carrying concealed weapons in a classroom that he believes he would not be able to concentrate, he might as well stop going to class. The people worthy of his anti-gun anxiety are going to carry whether it is against the rules or not.\n\n4) It kills me that he addresses the fact that taking away all guns is unwise because criminals will still obtain them illegally, yet he cannot apply this fact to his living environment. If criminals can have guns off-campus, there is absolutely NOTHING stopping them from bringing guns onto campus. Stripping responsible people of their right to defend themselves and the people around them because of ignorance and phobia is absolutely idiotic.\n\nThis article turned out to be completely anti-gun ownership.

Members that are interested in the conservative voice being hushed can see it on the TAC or Young Republican's pages, potentially even the main TAMU page, but I would appreciate if y'all would help in keeping this forum on the narrower topic of Concealed Carry/Gun control/etc. What happened with the administration is unfortunate and a loss to our organization as well as many others, but the specifics of how it pertains to this organization are most needed to know by the Tech guy (Andrew), the Chairman (me), or the VC (Hanah). \n     Justin Pulliam, I do not see your first message as much of an attack on Adam; however, I would also appreciate it if you, or any member, would not call another member out by name. We are all united by one cause and it is that we demand that school's allow us to exercise our right to the second amendment.

I agree that the post shouldn't have been on this wall and that it held higher precedence elsewhere, but at some point this should have been dropped. Both Justin and Toni are educated college adults and have been told the rules of the group. They now know, let it be, I am sure they will play by the rules now.\n\n     This group is here to unite those to support our right for licensed adults to legally conceal carry firearms with us when we go to campus. Each member is important to the group and people will not be deleted \"just because\", but at the same time, we need to respect the other members of this group and their separate political affiliations. I don't care about a person's opinion on anything but gun control and with respect to another member in the group, you shouldn't care either. I want this issue dropped and pacified. If for some reason it cannot be settled with my comments, feel free to send me a private message on Facebook.

The phrasing in Student Rule 24.3.6 never references either 34.06.02.M1 or 46.05(a). It instead creates it's own definition of weapon, along with a short list of things that are definitely included \"... The term weapon may be defined as any object or substance designed to inflict a wound, cause injury or pain, or to incapacitate. Weapons may include, but are not limited to, all firearms, pellet guns, slingshots, martial arts devices, switchblade knives and clubs.\" Based on my reading of that definition, I believe that pepper spray and electroshock devices are likely included under the definition of weapons, and for that reason, I would not advise someone that they are legal alternatives to a CCW on campus.\n\nOn a side note, good to see you around, whether we agree or not, you're always good for an intelligent discussion.", "type": "status", "id": "10675157588_10151279004037589"}

If you understand its inherent flaws and fallacies, you can invalidate it, often without needing to counter point it.", "id": "10151233364422589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "1535400608", "name": "Andrew Nelson"}, "like_count": 1, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-06-28T23:46:59+0000", "message": "The second: This video places the CHL holder in a bad position in all the scenarios shown. In any scenario where you must defend yourself or others, however, there is only one variable you can control, and that's you. Because you can't control where the threat comes from, how many there are, or what other people are going to do, you need to put yourself in a position to respond to whatever situation you may encounter. A lot like pro atheletes or musicians, you can't just show up to the game or the concert. You have to be ready for it the moment it comes, and unfortunately, unlike atheletes and musicians, you don't have it on a schedule. So how do you make sure that you are ready at every moment? You train, constantly, however you can. Doing drills on your own, taking classes or courses, practical shooting competitions, etc., all have their place. Drills build on your skills, classes teach you new techniques, and practical shooting works on your adaptability to new and varied situations. Play the \"What if...\" game, practice situational awareness by watching the people around you, anything. We all know people who place so much faith in their gun protecting them that they don't even realize the gun is just a tool to enable them to protect themselves. Don't be the guy/girl who just shows up to the game, be the one who's ready to play.", "id": "10151233365807589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "100001756791840", "name": "John Kochan"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-06-29T11:49:53+0000", "message": "Pay close attention to the way this was all set up.

As far as drills, practicing the draw stroke one step at a time and slowly until it is steady smooth is vital. Speed will come after you get smooth with it. The other is learning to safely draw while seated. Almost NO ONE practices that. Can be done dry at the house sitting at the dinning room table. Again, slow and smooth. There is nothing to be gained by being jerky and clumsy with it. As for targets, biggest thing is just being aware of your surroundings and paying attention to things that don't fit. Often times in interviews afterwards, people will point out that something was a little off about a person that turned out to be a bad actor, they just couldn't put a fine point on it before the action started. Pay attention to the voice in the back of your head, it is smarter than you think. If the hairs on the back of your neck stand up., PAY ATTENTION! You may not know exactly why but your brain does. As for a drill, play pretend while out in public. Look around and say, if X happens, I should do Y then Z. If there is someone else tactically minded, sound it out and discuss. That way, when something does happen, you have thought about it or something like it before and have a plan to start with rather than making it up as it happens. That right there is the big reason for doing force on force training.

Cotton \u00bb Sat May 19, 2012 1:44 pm\n\nI want to make a request of everyone coming into the 2012 elections and the 2013 Texas Legislative Session. As we get closer to the election and the beginning of pre-filing of bills for the 2013 Texas Legislative Session, the subject of open-carry is going to come up, probably numerous times. We have had a lot of new Members join since the 2011 legislative session and they may not know the history of that issue here on the Texas CHLforum.\n\nMy request is simple -- please keep discussions civil and respectful of differing opinions. No other subject has caused the level of acrimony and personal attacks against TexasCHLforum Members as seen when discussing open-carry. As in prior years, we can expect to see \"new\" (a/k/a previously banned Members) register again under new names to once again lie about Forum Members, TSRA, NRA and everyone else that does not actively and aggressively support the OpenCarry.org/LoneStarCDL version of open-carry. The Moderators will be watchful and these new folks will be banned as quickly as possible. Please do not let these people bate you into violating our rules. \n\nAlso for the Forum Members who have joined us since the 2011 Texas Legislative Session, I want to state as clearly and concisely as possible the position TSRA and I have taken on open-carry. \n\nNeither TSRA, Alice Tripp nor I oppose open-carry. Anything you hear to the contrary is false. If someone unknowingly states otherwise, it's a mistake; if done knowingly, it's a lie.\n\nNeither TSRA, Alice Tripp nor I have ever done one thing to block, oppose, or derail the filing or promoting of an open-carry bill. A very small but vocal group on other forums have falsely claimed otherwise, but they are either mistaken or lying.\n\nI have repeatedly stated that if the NRA or TSRA decide to support an open-carry bill, I'll support it as aggressively as I have every other bill we have passed. I'll even write the thing! Some less-than-honest bomb-throwing types have argued that my concerns about a repeat of what we saw in Texas from 1997 through Sept. 1, 1997 amounts to opposing open-carry. That's absurd, but it's indicative of the intellectual dishonesty to which they will resort. I also noted that a responsible open-carry bill could be drafted and supported, but any attempt should be preceded by an effective educational campaign to educate the public on the great track record CHLs have established since 1996. This would go a long way to prevent the business backlash that many fear, including me.\n\nThe most vocal and militant of open-carry supporters believe that open-carry will not pass unless either the NRA or TSRA or both actively campaign and support a bill. This may or may not be correct, but the bottom line is both organizations are accused of opposing open-carry simply because we won't blindly support anything LoneStarCDL wants to file. \n\nAgain, please keep open-carry discussions civil and within Forum Rules. Let's try hard not to have a repeat of 2009 and 2011.\n\nThanks,\nChas.", "id": "10151133873532589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "694588831", "name": "Matthew Ward"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2012-05-22T01:15:59+0000", "message": "I have been on and off that forum for about four years now and there are the people who support a general open carry with no stipulations for how to go about it (Think Vermont/New Mexico) and like all groups with a political idealology have they have a few nuts who will troll and date some members into an argument.

Figured I'd share, and since there wasn't a button to do this, I kept the info so the OP has credit\n\nBrian Apple-->Students for Concealed Carry on Campus\n21 hours ago near Baton Rouge, LA \u00b7 \n\nA long read if you have time, but I found this on 1911 forum and thought I would share it here... ENJOY!\n\nI'm over 60 and never been attacked. My parents have never been attacked. I understand my grandparents have never been attacked. My own family has never been attacked. My successive apartments and homes, nor those of my parents, have never been broken into. Never been robbed. I never witnessed a deadly attack in public. Family members have never been abducted. Never ever saw any kind of attack in my life. Its a safe society.\n\nSo why should I bother with the trouble and cost and pain in the belt/back of carrying a firearm? Isn't that being really paranoid? Those kind of people must think they are in a cowboy movie to do so. Life is not like that now.\n\nWell, my parents and my homes have never caught fire. Our cars have never been \"hit.\" But do I say \"why bother with insurance, and fire alarms, the high annual cost of central station service burglary and fire monitoring, and keeping up all those fire extinguishers\"?\n\nNo. I pay vast sums annually to big companies without question for extremely unlikely adverse events. I maintain a fire extinguisher in every one of my personal and company vehicles though I never saw a vehicle catch fire. What a high annual cost and pain these all have been and here all these years never needed them. Nope never needed all that. Big waste of money in hindsight. Paid a lot for insurance and protective services and devices each year... but will continue to do so FOR SOME REASON.\n\nBut wait! Did I cover everything? Did I neglect to get insurance for personal and family bodily harm from attacks or home intrusions with malice - surely as unlikely as a house fire but still possible? Wait! did I neglect to get insurance for abduction or rape of my daughters? I willingly pay for a lot for insurance, what about these risks? I can afford to pay for that protection too. Where do I send the check?\n\nSo ... there is no abduction nor rape insurance? Really? But it happens fairly often as I know from reading the news. No insurance against armed attacks in my home, to me while at my car, leaving the ATM?\n\nClearly there is reasonableness for the bother and cost of personal and family protection against life threats, bodily harm, theft and attacks on our children, each a matter that has been overlooked and certainly no less likely than a house fire or theft, nay more likely I would estimate. But there is NO INSURANCE POLICY against harm to your children I notice. NO INSURANCE that prevents physical harm by others against your person, wife, friends or your neighbors. I see I can't write a check to make these other risks go away.\n\nHow were these risks overlooked? Can't send a check to deal with these risks. Its clearly going to require some personal effort and initiative. Actually, more like personal RESPONSIBILITY that is not as easy as writing a check to an insurance company. I left my family and property unprotected. I stupidly thought \"insurance\" payments took care of everything. I thought our county sheriff would take care of this though I noticed it took 30 minutes for one to respond to a false alarm drop (county budget was cut to nothing). And firearm personal protection is less costly than fire and theft insurance.\n\nUnwittingly, my family and myself have been less than fully protected. I was sold a false sense of personal security by insurance companies and the promise of local law enforcement which in consideration is now recognized as extremely limited. I live in a rural area. I suspect law enforcement is just as limited in metropolitan areas. I gave away, tried to pay away, my personal protective responsibilities all those years. I assumed others would handle everything for me in THIS SOCIETY. I see now I really am alone to take care of myself.\n\nThat thing that's going to be on my belt (and the one in the car) - its going to be just another kind of fire extinguisher. Nothing weird about it. Its just another fire extinguisher. Can't have enough fire extinguishers.", "type": "status", "id": "10675157588_10150915575012589"}

He is a good, conservative guy - who has not yet really delved into the CCoC issue.    Here is what I wrote to him:\n\n(background, he had just told me he supports faculty & staff being allowed to carry on campus, but had concerns about students carrying)\n\nThat's good to hear - because the truth is, CCoC is not about students - it's about faculty & staff.  The \"students carrying\" is fear hype invented by those who are opposed to anyone carrying (and they know it).  It just gets mentioned alot by the media because - well, it's sensational and that's what the media does.\n\nConsider - a person has to be 21 before they are even allowed to apply for a license.  This fact by itself eliminates 3/4 of all underclassmen ( the freshman, sophomores, and a big chunk of the juniors).  Thne one has to consider that the CHL class costs north of $100 ; then they'd have to be able to afford the gun (and hopefully enough ammo & range time to practice) - as we know, most college kids are broke.  \n\nThe last time I looked, only 1.3% of the overall population of the state (over 21) had a CHL.

The .30-06 was a bad first gun for him, though. Way too much recoil. It freaked him out. Should've gone with the MP5.\n\nAlso, I just so happened to be telling a friend that I want to buy the Ruger SP101 .357, when a woman walked up with her relatively new one and told me that she wants to sell it, so I may be getting my first gun within the next few days. She wanted to sell it and buy a different revolver because she thinks the trigger is too hard to pull on the Ruger.\n\nSorry to use this wall like it's my blog, but just wanted to share my first gun experiences as a newbie.", "id": "10150291799122589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "1526580309", "name": "Travis Holt"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2010-11-23T20:16:55+0000", "message": "In my experience, most automatic firearms are going to run you around 10K+.", "id": "10150291799132589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "852729698", "name": "Robert Short"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2010-11-27T16:53:32+0000", "message": "Plus the licensing.", "id": "10150291799142589", "user_likes": false}]}, "created_time": "2010-11-12T07:10:41+0000", "message": "So, I fired a gun for the first time tonight.

Shot 236/280 points with 56 rounds. I'm certain it would have been 256/280 if I hadn't taken the stupid advice of my friend to \u201cgo for the head\", which gives zero points.\n\nNot bad for a first try. I credit the SCCC t-shirt with granting me marksmanship, and for getting me all sorts of thumbs-up and high-fives.\n\nAll-in-all, best $27 ever spent. When I was firing off those bursts, all my troubles melted away.\n\nCan't wait to get my SP101, but the feeling of firing an automatic weapon is awesome.

As proved through the tragic U.T. shooting this week, \u201cgun free zones\u201d do not inhibit criminals in the least bit. These zones only disarm law abiding citizens who wish to defend themselves. CHL holders are not \u201cvigilantes\u201d as was erroneously alluded to in the recent article. Individuals with CHL\u2019s are taught specifically to take a defensive situation and to only use their concealed firearm if their life is in immediate danger. This same argument of \u201cvigilantism\u201d was used when concealed carry was first implemented in Texas about 15 years ago, but these fears proved to baseless and the streets did not \u201crun with blood\u201d as opponents predicted. Fights did not escalate into shootings and in fact, violent crimes fell and have continued to fall after the implementation of concealed carry in Texas.\nCurrently, there are 71 campuses in the U.S. that allow concealed carry on campus and have done so for a combined total of over 124 semesters. There has not been a single resulting incident of gun violence (including threats and suicides), gun theft, or gun accident on any of these campuses. Crimes have actually fallen by an average of 4% on these campuses every year. This makes sense as concealed carry acts as an excellent deterrent against would-be criminals who would rather commit crimes in \u201cgun free zones\u201d than in places where they risk being injured or killed by their would-be victims.  College campuses play host to the same violent and non-violent crimes of the surrounding area. CHL holders are just as responsible on campus as they are off campus where they already carry, such as in shopping malls, movie theaters, restaurants, etc. Obviously, most people never think about this since the firearms have to be concealed to be legal with the license. They are out of sight and out of mind; hence they are not a distraction and criminals are more wary as they don\u2019t know if their potential victim is armed or not. \nIn the rare event of a mass shooting, CHL holders could stop a mass murder and save countless lives instead of being helpless and executed by the psychopath. Concealed carry has been proven not to increase the crime rate, but can save lives\u2014the benefits definitely outweigh the risks. To those who think they would pose a difficulty to law enforcement, the fact is that those with a CHL will comply with law enforcement and be easy to identify as they won\u2019t be the one randomly shooting at innocent people. To those who think there would not be enough time to stop a mass murderer, students and faculty deserve a fighting chance and it was proven at Virginia Tech that there was more than enough time to take the mass murderer down and save many lives. His weapon jammed, he was having difficulty reloading, and yet all students could do was watch in horror. Gun free zones disarmed these students, but allowed the criminal to walk right on by and execute his helpless victims. We would rather have a fighting chance to defend ourselves than stand idly by as a madman executes our fellow students. We hope this tragedy is never repeated and we hope that if it is, we will be allowed to be prepared. While we can\u2019t prevent mass murders and every day crimes, we can be prepared to defend ourselves and put a stop to them if they do occur. You don\u2019t expect to ever get in a car crash, but if you do, your seatbelt can save your life; we all hope never to have to use a gun, but it would be much better to have it and not need it than to need it, not have it. Please feel free to join Texas A&M Students for Concealed Carry on Campus on facebook if you agree with our cause. We currently have over 1,200 members and will have our next meeting on October 11th at 6:30 in Rudder 504.\n", "type": "status", "id": "10675157588_10150291796502589"}

What if I wanted to (in a concealed manner) carry nunchucks on campus? Ninja stars, OC spray, switchblades (in some states), knives longer than 5 inches? Should other offensive weapons be allowed on campus too?

Many are for it, while some others are vehemently against it. I used to often ask myself how something such as allowing people to defend themselves could be so controversial\u2014how there could possibly be a single soul who is opposed to it. I quickly learned that though concealed carry on campus is perfectly logical to many, some are opposed to concealed carry for reasons that have nothing to do with logic or facts. Some are opposed to concealed carry on campus simply because they fear guns\u2014whether this is media instilled, socially instilled through friends and professors, gained through biased media sources, or from a more complex subconscious reason such as being neglected and left out as a child while their father went hunting with friends. Some think guns are just \u201cbad\u201d and that those who have them are a danger to themselves and others. Some think that someone is going to be irresponsible and accidently shoot them. Some think that those who conceal carry are \u201ccowboys looking for a fight\u201d or vigilantes.\n\nNone of these reasons are logical and none of these reasons is based in either fact or reality. What is reality? First of all, guns have no will of their own, they are tools\u2014just as a pencil, a hammer, a car, or a shovel is a tool. Just as these tools do not decide to, or cause the user to misspell words, smash fingers, run red lights, or dig ditches, guns do not decide to fire. Guns are tools\u2014neither good nor evil and subject to the will of the user. Just as a hammer cannot put nails in walls, a pencil cannot write words, a car cannot drive, and a shovel cannot dig on its own, a gun cannot shoot on its own. There must be human input for a tool to even move.\n\nSo now that we have proven that a gun is a tool and cannot function on its own, it is both logical and it is a reality that guns do not kill people, people kill people. Now some will say, \u201coh, but we need those tools where guns only exist to kill people!\u201d, however, this is a very illogical perception. Guns exist for many reasons\u2014for self defense, to protect our country from threats both foreign and domestic, for hunting, for recreational target practice, and lastly as a collector\u2019s item. Just as any tool can be abused and its purpose twisted to kill innocents (jabbing a pencil into someone\u2019s windpipe, bashing someone\u2019s head in with a hammer, running them over with a car, decapitating them with a shovel), guns can be as well. Unlike these other weapons though, guns can be and are often used to save lives. Guns are the great equalizers of society\u2014no other way can a small, 5\u20193\u201d 110lb woman defend herself from a 6\u20193\u201d 230lb rapist; no other way could the Darwinist reality of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d be overturned by allowing the weak to defend themselves against the strong. Really, guns are a large reason for why our society is civilized\u2014after all, an armed society is a polite society. No matter how big or strong you are, would you attack/pick a fight with someone you knew was armed?\n\nNow, since we have determined that guns are tools and that they can be used to save innocent life, we will discuss why concealed carry is good as a prelude to why concealed carry on campus is the right and logical thing. Concealed carry has had a very successful history, with a dramatic in decrease in crime following its initiation. Those who have a concealed carry license are 500% less likely or 1/5 as likely to commit crimes as the general population. Those who have a concealed carry license have to go through extensive FBI background checks, go through training in order to receive their CHL, pay a large sum (usually around a couple hundred) for the license, and pass the range exam. Just because someone takes the class and pays for it doesn\u2019t mean they will automatically pass\u2014there\u2019s many ways to fail, such as if the instructor feels you are not responsible enough to have a CHL. During this training, you are taught to absolutely not shoot unless it is a last resort and your life is in immediate mortal danger. What has concealed carry contributed to crime? Absolutely nothing--\u201cconcealed\u201d means no one knows who is carrying, so no worries about some poor overly sensitive person being scared from seeing a gun. Criminals can\u2019t get a concealed carry license to begin with\u2014they carry concealed illegally already. Those who want to commit a crime and could potentially get a CHL will not go through the trouble and the expense to get one. The crime they\u2019re going to commit is illegal, so what\u2019s a charge for concealing a weapon on top of rape, robbery, or murder? Criminals will always get guns, no matter how hard we make it to get them. Obviously drugs are illegal, yet people easily still get those. The fact is that any market where money can be made, that commodity will be made, bought, and sold regardless of the law. How do we protect ourselves from these armed criminals? We make ourselves equal by arming ourselves. We are law abiding citizens and, therefore, follow the law\u2014hence why we want to get CHL\u2019s in order to conceal carry. We will only carry if the law allows us, where criminals will carry regardless. Think the police will protect you? Well, next time someone is trying to rob, rape, or murder you, see if they will wait while you call 911 and then wait while the police come. The fact is, unless everyone had their own personal guard who went with them everywhere 24/7, they can\u2019t be protected all the time. People have a right, a need, and a responsibility to defend themselves and their families/loved ones.\n\nNow we will get to the heart of the discussion, concealed carry on campus. I have heard the argument that guns on campus will inhibit people\u2019s learning ability because people will be scared seeing those guns. I will address this concern by pointing out that \u201cconcealed\u201d means no one will see it. Those who conceal carry are extremely careful not to show their firearms\u2014no one wants to be handed over to the police for \u201cbrandishing\u201d. I have heard that students will be careless and lose their firearms. I will address this by saying that those who conceal carry use conceal carry holsters under their clothes and always have their firearm on their person. They do not ever take their firearms out in public (the whole brandishing thing), firearms are very expensive on the whole, and if they do leave that firearm somewhere (which they won\u2019t), they have liability at stake with that firearm. No one is going to lose something that is always on them, is a safeguard to their life, that is very expensive, and that can get them sued or get in trouble with law enforcement for leaving somewhere. I have also heard that those who conceal carry are looking to shoot someone. To this I say that every one of those bullets has a lawyer behind it. Not only are you trained to only shoot when there is absolutely no other option, but no one wants to get sued or have to go before a grand jury. If a CHL holder does shoot someone in self defense, they have to prove that it was in self defense, they will have their firearm confiscated for a time for evidence, they can be sued by the criminal or the criminal\u2019s family, and if it is found that it was not in self defense, criminal charges will be filed, their license revoked, and they cannot buy any firearms from that point on. Lastly, I have heard people say that they fear a CHL holder will accidently shoot them or accidently discharge their firearm. For one thing, most self defense cases occur in near deserted places, where the criminal feels comfortable attacking someone. Secondly, in a mass murder situation, it is always better to risk wounding an innocent than for everyone in the room to be defenseless and summarily slaughtered as the mass murderer carries out their plot unchallenged. Lastly, most people that oppose concealed carry do not realize that everywhere they go, people are packing heat. Whenever someone goes to the grocery store, restaurant, movie theater, mall, private businesses, etc., there could be someone only a few feet away who is carrying. Just because you can\u2019t see the firearms doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there. Now if CHL holders have proven to be responsible in all of these places, why are they not allowed to carry on campus? The same people who want to carry on campus are the exact same people who carry all these other places without incident. It\u2019s obvious that campus\u2019s are not immune from crime and that there are no \u201cmagical barriers\u201d keeping criminals out.\n\nIf criminals can come onto a campus (an open environment), doesn\u2019t it make sense to allow law abiding citizens on campus to defend themselves? Shouldn't we change the school policy and allow self defense on campus? Or should we as a society respect each college administration for their choice of the mighty dollar over the well being and safety of their students? I personally choose not to help criminals as college administrations have by disarming their students--I choose to fight these selfish policies in order to give students a fighting chance. This is my choice, and it is my hopes that those who value the safety of themselves, their friends, and their fellow classmates will join me.", "type": "status", "id": "10675157588_10150291796507589"}

Suggestions and comments are appreciated. \n\nAn analysis on why Anti's oppose CCC and a reply to common myths spread by anti's about CCC:\n\nConcealed carry on campus has been a hot topic in recent years. Many are for it, while some others are vehemently against it. I used to often ask myself how something such as allowing people to defend themselves could be so controversial\u2014how there could possibly be a single soul who is opposed to it. I quickly learned that though concealed carry on campus is perfectly logical to many, some are opposed to concealed carry for reasons that have nothing to do with logic or facts. Some are opposed to concealed carry on campus simply because they fear guns\u2014whether this is media instilled, socially instilled through friends and professors, gained through biased media sources, or from a more complex subconscious reason such as being neglected and left out as a child while their father went hunting with friends. Some think guns are just \u201cbad\u201d and that those who have them are a danger to themselves and others. Some think that someone is going to be irresponsible and accidently shoot them. Some think that those who conceal carry are \u201ccowboys looking for a fight\u201d or vigilantes.\n\nNone of these reasons are logical and none of these reasons is based in either fact or reality. What is reality? First of all, guns have no will of their own, they are tools\u2014just as a pencil, a hammer, a car, or a shovel is a tool. Just as these tools do not decide to, or cause the user to misspell words, smash fingers, run red lights, or dig ditches, guns do not decide to fire. Guns are tools\u2014neither good nor evil and subject to the will of the user. Just as a hammer cannot put nails in walls, a pencil cannot write words, a car cannot drive, and a shovel cannot dig on its own, a gun cannot shoot on its own. There must be human input for a tool to even move.\n\nSo now that we have proven that a gun is a tool and cannot function on its own, it is both logical and it is a reality that guns do not kill people, people kill people. Now some will say, \u201coh, but we need those tools where guns only exist to kill people!\u201d, however, this is a very illogical perception. Guns exist for many reasons\u2014for self defense, to protect our country from threats both foreign and domestic, for hunting, for recreational target practice, and lastly as a collector\u2019s item. Just as any tool can be abused and its purpose twisted to kill innocents (jabbing a pencil into someone\u2019s windpipe, bashing someone\u2019s head in with a hammer, running them over with a car, decapitating them with a shovel), guns can be as well. Unlike these other weapons though, guns can be and are often used to save lives. Guns are the great equalizers of society\u2014no other way can a small, 5\u20193\u201d 110lb woman defend herself from a 6\u20193\u201d 230lb rapist; no other way could the Darwinist reality of \u201csurvival of the fittest\u201d be overturned by allowing the weak to defend themselves against the strong. Really, guns are a large reason for why our society is civilized\u2014after all, an armed society is a polite society. No matter how big or strong you are, would you attack/pick a fight with someone you knew was armed?\n\nNow, since we have determined that guns are tools and that they can be used to save innocent life, we will discuss why concealed carry is good as a prelude to why concealed carry on campus is the right and logical thing. Concealed carry has had a very successful history, with a dramatic in decrease in crime following its initiation. Those who have a concealed carry license are 500% less likely or 1/5 as likely to commit crimes as the general population. Those who have a concealed carry license have to go through extensive FBI background checks, go through training in order to receive their CHL, pay a large sum (usually around a couple hundred) for the license, and pass the range exam. Just because someone takes the class and pays for it doesn\u2019t mean they will automatically pass\u2014there\u2019s many ways to fail, such as if the instructor feels you are not responsible enough to have a CHL. During this training, you are taught to absolutely not shoot unless it is a last resort and your life is in immediate mortal danger. What has concealed carry contributed to crime? Absolutely nothing--\u201cconcealed\u201d means no one knows who is carrying, so no worries about some poor overly sensitive person being scared from seeing a gun. Criminals can\u2019t get a concealed carry license to begin with\u2014they carry concealed illegally already. Those who want to commit a crime and could potentially get a CHL will not go through the trouble and the expense to get one. The crime they\u2019re going to commit is illegal, so what\u2019s a charge for concealing a weapon on top of rape, robbery, or murder? Criminals will always get guns, no matter how hard we make it to get them. Obviously drugs are illegal, yet people easily still get those. The fact is that any market where money can be made, that commodity will be made, bought, and sold regardless of the law. How do we protect ourselves from these armed criminals? We make ourselves equal by arming ourselves. We are law abiding citizens and, therefore, follow the law\u2014hence why we want to get CHL\u2019s in order to conceal carry. We will only carry if the law allows us, where criminals will carry regardless. Think the police will protect you? Well, next time someone is trying to rob, rape, or murder you, see if they will wait while you call 911 and then wait while the police come. The fact is, unless everyone had their own personal guard who went with them everywhere 24/7, they can\u2019t be protected all the time. People have a right, a need, and a responsibility to defend themselves and their families/loved ones.\n\nNow we will get to the heart of the discussion, concealed carry on campus. I have heard the argument that guns on campus will inhibit people\u2019s learning ability because people will be scared seeing those guns. I will address this concern by pointing out that \u201cconcealed\u201d means no one will see it. Those who conceal carry are extremely careful not to show their firearms\u2014no one wants to be handed over to the police for \u201cbrandishing\u201d. I have heard that students will be careless and lose their firearms. I will address this by saying that those who conceal carry use conceal carry holsters under their clothes and always have their firearm on their person. They do not ever take their firearms out in public (the whole brandishing thing), firearms are very expensive on the whole, and if they do leave that firearm somewhere (which they won\u2019t), they have liability at stake with that firearm. No one is going to lose something that is always on them, is a safeguard to their life, that is very expensive, and that can get them sued or get in trouble with law enforcement for leaving somewhere. I have also heard that those who conceal carry are looking to shoot someone. To this I say that every one of those bullets has a lawyer behind it. Not only are you trained to only shoot when there is absolutely no other option, but no one wants to get sued or have to go before a grand jury. If a CHL holder does shoot someone in self defense, they have to prove that it was in self defense, they will have their firearm confiscated for a time for evidence, they can be sued by the criminal or the criminal\u2019s family, and if it is found that it was not in self defense, criminal charges will be filed, their license revoked, and they cannot buy any firearms from that point on. Lastly, I have heard people say that they fear a CHL holder will accidently shoot them or accidently discharge their firearm. For one thing, most self defense cases occur in near deserted places, where the criminal feels comfortable attacking someone. Secondly, in a mass murder situation, it is always better to risk wounding an innocent than for everyone in the room to be defenseless and summarily slaughtered as the mass murderer carries out their plot unchallenged. Lastly, most people that oppose concealed carry do not realize that everywhere they go, people are packing heat. Whenever someone goes to the grocery store, restaurant, movie theater, mall, private businesses, etc., there could be someone only a few feet away who is carrying. Just because you can\u2019t see the firearms doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not there. Now if CHL holders have proven to be responsible in all of these places, why are they not allowed to carry on campus? The same people who want to carry on campus are the exact same people who carry all these other places without incident. It\u2019s obvious that campus\u2019s are not immune from crime and that there are no \u201cmagical barriers\u201d keeping criminals out.\n\nIf criminals can come onto a campus (an open environment), doesn\u2019t it make sense to allow law abiding citizens on campus to defend themselves? Shouldn't we change the school policy and allow self defense on campus? Or should we as a society respect each college administration for their choice of the mighty dollar over the well being and safety of their students? I personally choose not to help criminals as college administrations have by disarming their students--I choose to fight these selfish policies in order to give students a fighting chance.

At VT, if one student in that first classroom was armed--wouldn't you agree that he could have stopped the madman? \n\nIf someone wants to do harm to someone else, they yes they'll try--the question is, will you be armed and able to defend your life? This is what we're fighting for. Holstered pistols obviously do no harm everywhere else they are carried and you tell me how a holstered pistol (people wont be waving them around) can even go off and cause an \"accident\". Most gun accidents are from improper handling, improper cleaning, or hunting--never heard of or could imagine a CHL holder's pistol just up and going off... \n\n", "id": "10150291797072589", "user_likes": false}, {"from": {"id": "8314774", "name": "Travis Kiser"}, "like_count": 0, "can_remove": false, "created_time": "2009-07-30T20:00:23+0000", "message": "I see what your saying about the difference in combat and a non combat related issue...

Then you couldn't control people just walking around, and I don't think we want to make campus a walled in razor wired prison yard, lol. We want to make sure that EVERYONE that has a CHL can carry becuase if you allow just the professors to carry, then they become the first target if a shooting were to happen, and we do not want to endanger our profs. It also is part of the advantage that someone wanting to do harm doesn't know who could be carrying. If we put a giant red flag on those who are, it defeats the purpose of concealed carry, its the element of suprise that is the major advantage for someone with a CHL. That way the grad student  TA walking back to her car in west campus garage after cleaning up a lab in heldenfelds is not an easy target anymore. I wrote a note in my notes portion of my profile all about why concealed carry on campus is important far beyond the school shooting aspect, I think you would enjoy reading it.
