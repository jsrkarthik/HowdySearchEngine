The open competitions at the state tourneys I competed in ranged from 30 to 40 competitors. Lets say 34.  Let's say the tourney director divides these into 6 groups of 5 (one group of 4). A group will have players A through E (or D). Player A is highest rated.  In your group, A plays E, B plays D, C plays B, etc., usually ending with A playing B and always ending with everyone playing everyone else. When all groups are finished, then group winners are in a group A, runner-ups in B, etc. In our tourneys, I think each of these sections then went by single-elimination (could have been double) until each group has a winner and a runner up.  It may also be that the winners of A and B play each other, I don't recall.

Play as many as you like, but you do need to check when they are scheduled and avoid signing up for two events that start at exactly the same time (they can overlap). \n\n     But the question may be more about how your skill level equates to ranking.  Well here are two benchmarks:  For those who've played me (guy with unusual racquet handle), my USATT ranking is 835; my high was 923.  For those who played Walter Alomar when he visited the week of April 8, Walter's ranking is 2165 (the last recorded tourney was July '09; it's been solidly over 2100 since '02.  That's a wide range, indeed.  Hope it helps. \n\n     Besides the 'under' events, I'd urge everyone to sign up for the Open (#1) if the price is not too much, because it is organized as a \"round robin\". This will give you tons of playing against players from the most advanced to beginners and, who knows, maybe you can win the entire tournament!\n\n     Another great option is doubles (two events, #19 & #20). Both are fair game (assuming at least one of the team is unrated).  But start training with your partner soon! If you were over 40, then the age events are open to you, at least one.\n\n-John\n\nEvent #    Event Name    Entries\n1    Open    25\n2    Women's Singles    5\n3    Over40    6\n4    Over50    3\n5    Over60    0\n6    Under2500 SE    4\n7    Under2375    16\n8    Under2250    21\n9    Under2125    19\n10    Under2000    16\n11    Under1850    15\n12    Under1700    9\n13    Under1550    9\n14    Under1400    3\n15    Under1250    3\n16    Under1100    4\n17    Under950    3\n18    Under800/Unrated    3\n19    Open Doubles SE    6\n20    U3600 Doubles SE    3", "type": "status", "id": "228043210624066_310569789038074"}
