It was my ZIP year and I will never forget it. \nJust weeks prior to this tragedy, I had met Chris Heard, who was a freshman in the Corps. He had run up to me on the Quad and whipped out to me. I dropped handles with him quickly in order to save the structure of the bones in my hand as he had a crushing grip. This young man was still a first semester fish, but he was completely squared away. Chris and I talked as we walked across campus. When I asked Chris why he joined the Corps, he said, \u201c I want to be like my dad and serve in the military.\u201d My own son had been born just months prior and I thought to myself, what a wonderful thing that he looks up to his father like that; I hope I can earn that level of respect with my son one day. \nChris and I made a habit of walking to class on Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays until he was tragically killed at Bonfire. \nWhen I went out to take this picture last year, I was overcome with emotions that I thought I had dealt with, but experiences such as this always stay with you. \nI will also never forget the support that was shown by the 12th Man in the days that followed, that is one of the qualities of Texas A&M that will never be able to be quantified.", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "15746305617_10153501906320618", "description": "The Last Corps Trip Photograph by David Morefield - The Last Corps Trip Fine Art Prints and Posters for Sale"}

I'm not sure what action should be taken towards these students. But I do know an apology from the head of Fish Camp is not enough. Maybe they should meet face to face with the family members of the 12 we lost. Maybe they should be made to watch the footage taken that day and the days following to fully understand the grief we felt...and still feel. Maybe they should be kicked out of Fish Camp.

The feelings are indescribable for former students that lived through it all.  I remember riding the bus to campus the morning after and we all wept together the entire way to campus.  The silence was deafening and all that could be heard was weeping.  It is one moment in my life that I will never forget.  The Bonfire Memorial is a sacred place.  My opinion may not make a difference, but I definitely don't think they should be Fish Camp counselors.  Fish Camp will teach you about Aggie traditions, what we are and who we are.

She is one of 7 finalists and the only representative of Texas A&M (WHOOP!). The winner will be chosen by the public and she needs your votes! I\u2019d really appreciate if you could spare a couple minutes and vote for her photo.\n\nDani is a Sport Management major and will be graduating in the Spring. She has funded her entire college education through grants, scholarships and working several part-time jobs. Winning this scholarship would mean so much to her and our family. It would ease the work load she is currently under and give her an opportunity to relax a little during her last semester. She is an awesome young woman and I could not be more proud of what she has accomplished and the person she has become while at Texas A&M. She bleeds maroon and will be the first person to tell you what an amazing place A&M is and how much being a student there has positively influenced her life.\n\nTo vote for Dani, simply click this link and create an account: http://contest.taxslayerplayer.com/photo/finalists. You can create an account using your Facebook account or by just entering your email address. Voting ends on December 12 and you can vote once a day. I\u2019m asking all of my Aggie Network friends and family to please help Dani. Even if you vote just once, that will really help. But if you can vote once a day until the 12th, that would be awesome! Right now she is way behind the leader and I know that if we can put her ahead with the power of the Aggie Nation!\n\nThank you in advance for your help and support. Her photo is the last one on the page. It is by far the coolest one!\n\nGig 'em! -- Melissa Houser '01", "type": "status", "id": "15746305617_10152274716205618"}

I am currently studying abroad in Brazil with Texas A&M and need help covering the expenses of this unique educational experience.  \n\nThe cost of this program was $11,000.  I received $4,000 in scholarships and had initially raised enough money over the last year to pay for the remaining expenses. Unfortunately, I had to have surgery for gallstones.  Although I have student insurance, it did not cover $5,000 of my medical costs.  The money I had saved for study abroad had to be used for my medical bills and I had to take out loans to pay for my study abroad expenses.  While abroad, I have a limited spending budget so I am in the process of developing a pamphlet for students titled \"how to survive in Brazil on $10 a day!\"\n\nI am contacting you in the hopes that you can help me to re-pay my loans for study abroad and to increase my budget for day-to-day expenses such as food.\n\nSome may ask why I still choose to study abroad given my financial situation?  Due to time of everything, I was in a situation that I would have had to take out a loan to pay the withdrawal penalties or take out a loan to proceed forward with participating in the program.  Additionally, as an Aerospace Engineering student there are few opportunities for us to integrate international experiences into our curriculum.  The courses I am taking on my program are advanced materials (i.e. composites) and rocket science (yes it really is rocket science-but the course is technically called rocket propulsion.  Last, but most importantly, the aerospace field is currently shifting its activities to Brazil.  As a result, there are few people who have experience in Brazil.  This once in a lifetime experience is helping me to earn academic credit needed for my major and will enhance my resume by providing me with needed knowledge.  \n\nAny financial assistance you can provide would be greatly appreciated.  Please feel free to check back to learn more about my program and journey.\n\nThanks for your time and consideration!\n\nShivani Ghai\n\nhttp://www.gofundme.com/w5a6s", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "15746305617_10151914489655618", "description": " Howdy!
