We are looking for undergraduate student workers to help set up the telescopes for the star parties.  We have a group of students who have helped with the star parties in the past and are looking to add more students to the group. For each star party, a group of three student workers will set up telescopes (weather permitting) at one of two locations on campus, stay with the telescopes while visitors use them to view the night sky, and put them away at the end of the night.   Students are paid $50 per star party.  No previous experience is required, only an interest in astronomy. \n\nIf you are interested in helping with the Mitchell Institute star parties, please come to the organizational meeting on Wednesday, January 15 at 5pm in the Munnerlyn building.

If you don\u2019t include this information, it slows down the process since we will have to email you back to ask for it. If you receive a registration error for a class, please be sure to include the type of error you received, that helps us apply the appropriate override.\n\n3. Be aware that we can only force or override for TLAC classes.  If you need assistance with a course taught by another department, you will need to contact that department directly.
