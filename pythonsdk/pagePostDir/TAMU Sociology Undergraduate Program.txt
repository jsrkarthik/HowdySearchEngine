Harbor Hospice of Central Houston is committed to providing quality hospice services to residents living within the Greater Houston Metropolitan Area. We take a team approach in the delivery of care to each of our patients. We believe that physicians, nurses, home health aides, social workers, spiritual counselors, volunteers, and family are the key to the continuum of care provided by Harbor Hospice that ultimately enhances the overall quality of life for each of our patients. \nThis is an excellent opportunity for students that want hands-on experience with hospice and palliative care during the summer. Volunteers at Harbor Hospice can participate in direct or in-direct patient care through the following activities: \nAdministrative Support: Assist the Harbor Hospice staff with filing, copying, data entry, answering phones, creating information packets, inventory and unpacking supplies. \nClient Resource Research: Work closely with the Harbor Hospice social work team to research assistance programs for patients.\nCaregiver Relief: Sit with the patient and allow the caregiver to take a break from their care-giving responsibilities. \nCorrespondence Team: Assist with creating and/or writing encouraging cards and letters to our patients and their caregivers.\nTuck-in Team: Make telephone calls to our patients or caregivers to see how their day has gone and to offer them encouragement and companionship support.\nCompanionship Support: Visit with patients and/or their caregivers to provide companionship support by talking & reminiscing with them, reading aloud to them, listening to music together, and praying with them.\nBereavement Support: Offer mental and emotional support to bereaved family members both before and after death through visits, correspondence, phone calls, counseling, and participation in the Bereavement Support Groups and Memorial Services. \nHarbor Hospice provides free training for all volunteers, and volunteer service hours are flexible.

Start prepping for the GRE sooner rather than later. If math is your big concern, 5 to 15 hours of targeted practice might get you up to speed.

CCH is working to create a new model for healthcare delivery, by developing programs and innovative strategies to move care from the hospital or doctor\u2019s office into the day-to-day lives of patients.  Leveraging information technology \u2013 cell phones, computers, networked devices and simple remote health monitoring tools \u2013 CCH is helping providers and patients manage chronic conditions, maintain health and wellness, and improve adherence, engagement and clinical outcomes. By collecting and presenting accurate physiologic and behavioral data to both patients and providers, our connected health initiatives are facilitating data-driven coaching and as-needed provider involvement to help achieve patient care goals.\n\nAs a summer intern at CCH, you will be a member of an interdisciplinary research team comprised of clinicians, social and behavioral scientists, public health and healthIT professionals. Interns will participate in day-to-day CCH activities, including meetings with collaborators from affiliate institutions, other Partners centers, and corporate sponsors.\n\nGraduate interns must select a research focus area and propose a project that can be completed during the 10-week summer internship. Projects may consist of exhaustive literature reviews, identifying funding opportunities and crafting a research proposal, secondary data analysis, and the design and collection of data to answer specific research questions. For all projects, graduate interns will work closely with Center research mentors and are expected to collaborate on co-authored reports, research proposals, or manuscripts due at the end of the summer program. Additionally, graduate interns will be expected to mentor and work effectively with undergraduate interns to complete projects. Three or four graduate students interns will be accepted for the summer internship.\n\nUndergraduate interns will have a general interest in healthcare delivery and technology. During the summer, undergraduate interns will work with the CCH research staff and graduate interns on a variety of programs and research projects. Tasks could include, but are not limited to literature reviews, survey design, focus group coordination, data analysis, team presentations, patient recruitment/retention and overall administrative support. At the conclusion of the summer, undergraduate interns will complete a two-page summary of their activities and describe what they have learned during the internship program. CCH is planning to accept between two and five undergraduate interns.\n\nWho Should Apply?\n\nInternships are open to students enrolled across the full spectrum of disciplines, including, but not limited to:\n -  Clinical (medical, nursing, or other healthcare professions), physiology and biology\n -  Public health, health communication, psychology, sociology, anthropology, and political science\n -  Business, economics, health care organization and policy, and marketing\n -  Computer science, information technology (IT), human computer interaction (CHI), health informatics, and social media\n -  Internships are open to students at different levels of academic study including those in bachelor\u2019s, master\u2019s, medical school, and Ph.D. programs. Exceptional high school students will also be considered.\n -  Summer interns need not be U.S. residents or in school in the U.S.; indeed, we encourage international students to apply.\n\nTime Commitment, Office Hours, Pay and Benefits\n\nSummer internships are part-time positions (20 hours/week) for 10 weeks. Our Summer 2014 program runs from about Monday, June 2 through Friday, August 8. Interns will have regularly scheduled office hours and be expected to attend weekly meetings to receive training and update mentors on work in progress.\n\nUndergraduate interns are paid $11.50 an hour. Limited support may be available for graduate students.\n\nPlease be forewarned that you will be required to cover all of your living expenses during your stay in the Boston area. No other benefits are provided, and interns must make their own housing, insurance, and transportation arrangements.\n\nSummer 2014 Research Opportunities\n\nCCH is focused on the following research topics during Summer 2014.\n\n(1) Clinical Outcomes and Interventions to Improve Healthcare \u2013 CCH has a long history of creating innovative programs using CHT to improve healthcare and clinical outcomes. This research includes the use of remote teleconsultation services, remote monitoring and care for patients with chronic conditions, and using wireless activity trackers to provide tailored feedback to encourage physical activity and weight management. CCH is making increasing use of social media platforms to target interventions and connect people with similar health issues to create communities to provide social support and tailored information. In this focus area, you may be expected to evaluate completed programs, create evaluation plans for on-going programs, or assist with data collection, transcription, analysis or manuscript preparation. Current projects at CCH include:\n -  Evaluation of existing remote monitoring programs to determine cost effectiveness and impact on clinical outcomes.\n -  Mobile application to improve cancer pain management; adherence to oral anti-cancer medications.\n -  Text messaging programs aimed to improve knowledge and self-care among pregnant women.\n -  Programs using social media (e.g., Facebook) for nutrition and weight management programs aimed at women with young children and women in disadvantaged communities.\n\n(2) Patient Engagement, Technology Adoption and Acceptance, Health and Digital Lifestyles \u2013 The rapid diffusion of mobile devices and wireless Internet connectivity presents a tremendous opportunity to create new connected health systems designed to empower patients to be proactive in managing their health and medical treatment. To ensure the success of these new healthcare systems, CCH is beginning a multi-year survey project designed to collect patient data on to understand patient\u2019s current needs, preferences, and adoption of CHT. We are particularly interested in research investigating:\n -  Creation and validation of a survey instrument to assess technology acceptance and likelihood of engagement with CHT\n -  Identifying key social, demographic, ecological, and psychological factors that limited the effectiveness of CHT interventions (e.g., how health literacy may limit the usefulness of  CHT)\n -  Patient adoption of self-tracking to monitor physical activity and health status.\n -  Research investigating how to improve the adoption, usability, and satisfaction with new CHT among patients.\n\n(3) Mapping Theories of Motivation Psychological Well-Being, and Behavior Change \u2013 Understanding human motivation is central to developing effective health behavior programs, including those using technological tools. This project aims to create a concept map that brings together some of the more widely studied theories and models of motivation and behavior change (e.g., Transtheoretical Model, Self-Determination Theory, BJ Fogg's Behavior Model, Social-Cognitive Theory, Cognitive Behavioral Therapy, etc.). Deliverables for this project would include both a visual map as well as a written document communicating how these different theories connect, overlap, and offer distinct perspectives on motivation and health behavior.\n -  A review of the literature on theories and models of motivation and behavior change.\n -  Review of available research/program funding opportunities and the development of a proposal seeking to secure funds for future research or program.\n -  Design and pilot testing of programs designed to increase motivation for sustained behavior change.\n\n(4) mHealth and Smartphone Application Development \u2013 CCH is working on a number of projects that make use of smartphones and tablet computers to collect data, deliver actionable information to patients and clinicians, and enable communication between patients (peer-to-peer) or between patients and healthcare providers. We are seeking interns with skills and experience in computer science, human computer interaction, and related fields to aid in generating research proposals, identify new ways to use smartphones and tablet computers to improve healthcare, and the development and testing of mHealth applications (apps).\n\nHow To Apply\n\nComplete the required application materials listed below for either the undergraduate or graduate internship position.

Unspeakable Violence addresses the epistemic and physical violence inflicted on racialized and gendered subjects in the U.S.\u2013Mexico borderlands from the midnineteenth century through the early twentieth. Arguing that this violence was fundamental to U.S., Mexican, and Chicano nationalisms, Nicole M. Guidotti-Hern\u00e1ndez examines the lynching of a Mexican woman in California in 1851, the Camp Grant Indian Massacre of 1871, the racism evident in the work of anthropologist Jovita Gonzalez, and the attempted genocide of the Yaqui Indians in the Arizona\u2013Sonora borderlands between 1876 and 1907. Guidotti-Hern\u00e1ndez shows that these events have been told and retold in ways that have produced particular versions of nationhood and effaced other issues. Scrutinizing stories of victimization and resistance, and celebratory narratives of mestizaje and hybridity in Chicana/o, Latina/o and borderlands studies, she contends that by not acknowledging the racialized violence perpetrated by Mexicans, Chicana/os, and indigenous peoples, as well as Anglos, narratives of resistance and mestizaje inadvertently privilege certain brown bodies over others. Unspeakable Violence calls for a new, transnational feminist approach to violence, gender, sexuality, race, and citizenship in the borderlands.

The preponderance of evidence from the colorism literature suggest that; In summary, the preponderance of evidence from the colorism literature suggest that; (1) the phenomenon of colorism did not end with the abolition of slavery, the decline of colonialism, nor the Civil Rights and Black Power Movements, (2) colorism and the preferential treatment assigned to individuals with more proximate Eurocentric phenotype is a global phenomenon that is commonly found in phenotypically heterogeneous societies, (3) the penalties and advantages associated with skin color are imposed not just by non-whites, but by whites as well, (4) there are material and social incentives for darker skinned individuals to attempt to \u201cwhiten\u201d their appearance, and (5) the genetic similarity of individuals across skin shade, along with the common finding of neighborhood and family background across skin shade groups within racial groups is indicative that variations of life outcomes based on skin shade are less attributable to genetic or cultural variation, and more attributable to differential societal treatment across skin shade group.  This talk will examine colorism is these domains and in particular examine colorism as it relates to wage and marriage outcomes in the US. \n \nShort Bio:\n \nDarrick Hamilton is an Associate Professor of Economics and Urban Policy at Milano \u2013 The New School for International Affairs, Management and Urban Policy, an affiliated faculty member in the Department of Economics at The New School for Social Research.

All are welcome!  \n\nThis workshop assumes no background in network theory or network analysis software.  It is designed interactive and a laptop is highly recommended.  You are free to attend without your laptop however the experience will be significantly less helpful as we will be working first-hand with network software.  The software is downloadable from the Ucinet website and a 60 day free trial is available.  Therefore, there is no need to purchase software for the workshop.

This event will feature a panel of experts who will discuss the ongoing crisis in Syria.\n\nThe war began in March 2011 with the streets of Damascus filling up with people protesting against the dictatorial regime of Bashar al-Asad, and to this day, the rebel opposition and the loyalist forces are engaged in a fight that threatens the lives of millions of Syrians and exacerbates the humanitarian crisis in the country. In the two years since the fighting began, the UN estimates that more than 100,000 Syrians have been killed, mostly rebel fighters and civilians. As a result of the fighting, over 4.5 million Syrians have been displaced internally, and over 2.2 million Syrians have become international refugees. One of the largest refugee camps, the Zaatari refugee camp, is located across the border in Jordan and home to over 150,000 Syrian refugees.\n\nThe United States has put into a place a full-scale embargo against Syria, but has taken military action off the table despite President Obama's assertion that the use of chemical weapons may draw such a response. As a result of Russia's continued support of Syria, relations between the United States and Russia have become markedly tenser. The United States and the rest of international community have shifted their focus to what they can do to help the Syrian people and bring this bloody conflict to a peaceful and fair end while ensuring Syrian stability moving forward. Although the use of chemical weapons against civilians did not prompt an immediate US military response to the crisis, the US did agree to seize and destroy Syrian chemical weapons under international oversight. Will the destruction of chemical weapons stockpiles satisfy the West and overcast the larger proportion of conventional brutality? How will the US respond to the humanitarian crisis in the coming months? How will this crisis affect US-Russia relations?\n\nTo see the Facebook page for this event, please visit: https://www.facebook.com/mscwiley.

Genomics and Society  \n\nM/W 4.10-5.25 in YMCA 109\n\nCourse Description: This course provides an introduction to, and an exploration of, controversial issues relating to genomics in society. It considers social, ethical and policy questions raised by genomics in the context of: synthetic biology and biofuels, crops, genetic modification of domestic animals, the use of genetics in wildlife conservation, human genetic therapies, human enhancement, and privacy questions raised by the disclosure of genetic information.  The course will include a number of invited expert speakers in different areas of genomics, ethics, and society, from a variety of colleges across Texas A&M, and from outside the university. It will also include discussion of a number of topical and contested cases in genomics. Genomics and Society has been funded for development by a grant from the National Science Foundation, and will eventually exist as an online, as well as a \"live\" or \"hybrid\" course on campus. Consequently some speaker sessions in Spring 2014 will be filmed, and we will be using online discussion tools in the course.  \n\nStudents are not required to have a background in genomics or in philosophy.  The course should be accessible to students from backgrounds across the sciences, social sciences and humanities. For more information contact Clare Palmer at c.palmer@tamu.edu\n\nThis course can fulfill 3 hours of humanities credit and 3 hours of residency for sociology majors.", "type": "status", "id": "141996652530399_631176893612370", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}
