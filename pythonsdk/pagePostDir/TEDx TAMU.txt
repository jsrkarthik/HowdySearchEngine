TEDxTAMU is only 2 days away!!!!!!\n\nAndrew Roblyer took the stage in his first lead role at age 6 and made his directorial debut in his backyard the following year. Even at that young age, the power of storytelling fascinated him. Nearly two decades later, Andrew\u2019s love of theatre is rivaled only by his passion for exploring the nature of communication and the power of story. This passion has expressed itself in many forms throughout Andrew\u2019s life, and while some may seem unrelated, they all contribute to his unique perspective on art, storytelling, and relationship.\n\nAndrew graduated from Texas A&M (Class of 2011) with a degree in Theatre Arts. During his time at Texas A&M, Andrew founded The Honorable Bards, an entirely student-run theatre company which provided an artistic outlet for students in technical and otherwise time-consuming degree programs. He was selected as a student director for the inaugural Texas A&M Student New Works Festival and premiered his first short play, Collage: A Trilogy at the same festival two years later. Andrew has also studied classical ballet and ballroom dance and was both a competitor and coach in competitive forensics at the high school and college level.\n\nOutside of theatre, Andrew\u2019s interest in intercultural dialogue and communication led to his selection as the Secretary General for the first Model Arab League conference held at Texas A&M University. He was also the first Texas A&M student to be accepted to the U.S. State Department Critical Language Scholarship Program, allowing him to travel abroad to study Arabic and learn about Middle Eastern theatre along the way.\n\nAndrew is a founding board member of Homeschool Alumni Reaching Out, an organization that uses narrative and storytelling to empower those who grew up in abusive homeschooling environments. The empowering nature of storytelling has also led Andrew to be actively involved in organizations such as the Texas A&M GLBT Resource Center, where he was an active member of the Speakers Bureau, and the Gay Christian Network (GCN), where he volunteers as an official GCN Ambassador to promote healthy dialogue and relationship.\n\nCurrently, Andrew is the Founder and Artistic Director of This Is Water Theatre, the first and only professional theatre company in Bryan/College Station, TX, where he is working to challenge how the \u201cFacebook Generation\u201d thinks about theatre.", "type": "photo", "id": "570926219593243_756600494359147", "status_type": "added_photos", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"}

If you won't be able to go to the event physically, you can also watch it from the comfort of your home at tedxtamu.com!!!\n\nToday's Speaker is W. R. (Bill) Klemm:\n\nW. R. (Billl) Klemm is a neuroscientist with a large number of research publications and substantial international recognition of his research. Trained in fundamental biology and raised in Christian tradition, he is well aware of the clash between the scientific principles of evolution and certain religious doctrines. And, as a neuroscientist, he also sees a growing clash over the scientific view that mind comes from brain and the religious view of an immortal soul. It would seem that on both fronts, religion is fighting a losing battle. There is no doubt that mind clearly resides in the brain. Unresolved is the question of whether the brain is the only place mind exists.\n \n\nToday's major religions arose from the Middle East and Asia and are largely unchanged from their primitive state more than two millennia ago. None of these have adequately accommodated science. We still quibble over evolution. How will we acquire the boldness and insight to accommodate the science of mind with religion? Many people do not think accommodation is possible, yet Dr. Klemm argues that neuroscience and religion can and should inform each other. After all, religious beliefs are constructed from what brains think. There is room in this universe for both. Indeed, Klemm believes that science and what we call spirituality are what the universe is all about.\n\nIn recent years, Dr. Klemm has been pondering such things. Some of his colleagues have called him a \"Renaissance man\" because his thinking about neuroscience extends into other fields such as medicine, psychology, education, law, social and political interactions, as well as religion. In the Fall of 2013, he took the unprecedented leap of creating a college course at Texas A&M University in Neuroscience and Religion, which he plans to continue and eventually hopes to take on-line to a mass audience.\n\nHe has a new book being released in April by Prometheus/Random House: Mental Biology. The New Science of How Brain and Mind Relate.", "type": "photo", "id": "570926219593243_755311594488037", "status_type": "added_photos", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yz/r/StEh3RhPvjk.gif"}

She is presently the President & CEO of Hope Stone, Inc., and Artistic Director of Hope Stone Dance Company and the Pink Ribbons Project.  Jane founded Hope Stone with a dream of unlocking the innate creativity of children and adults and improving their quality of life through the performing arts. Hope Stone Studio is a dance and movement facility in Houston where exercise, good fun, and community meet. Jane also founded and directs Hope Stone Kids, an arts outreach program for children 6-18 years old in Houston, Katy, and New Orleans that uses master teachers in dance, theater, music, photography, and yoga to empower and educate youth. Hope Stone Kids was created to help meet the artistic and emotional needs of underserved and at-risk students. \u201cI see the void and want to help fill it,\u201d Jane says.
