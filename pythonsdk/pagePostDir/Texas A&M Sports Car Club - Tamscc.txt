Tommy and Kyle of Team Oil Slick defeated their arch rivals, Trey and Maria, and secured the third spot on the expert podium.

Rallyes are a great event for discovering the town, making stories, getting lost, and just plain having a good time. Plus there's a gathering at the end... so... yeah.\n\nWhat is this rallye business?\nOur rallyes are a Time Speed Distance rallye. You are given a set of coded directions (SSS = Straight at Stop Sign, R1 = First right, etc). Your objective is to make it through the directions. However, you also are trying to get through the directions to each of 3 checkpoints in the ideal amount of time (based on how far it is between checkpoints and what your average speed (CAST) is on those roads). THIS IS NOT A RACE. Getting there first doesn't make you the winner. Speeds are even set 5 MPH below the legal speed limit. You get points for every second early or late you are. Lowest score wins. This all sounds really complicated, but it's a blast. If you're new, don't worry. Just making it to the finish is quite an accomplishment and gives you a good shot at winning a trophy! There is an expert and novice class, so you won't be competing against people that have done this for 4 years. \n\nDown to business: What to bring?\nDriver: Full gas tank (be ready to drive at least 80 miles).\nNavigator: Clipboard, pen/pencil, flashlight.\nAlso, you can pile in as many people as you want, or legally can, into your car!\n\nONLY EXPERT CLASS IS ALLOWED TO HAVE A GPS!\n\nPrices are (per car) Members $5, Non-Members $10.", "type": "status", "id": "165122020337261_235658333283629", "status_type": "mobile_status_update"}

Post dinner meet is once again at veteran's park at 8:30. \n\n2. Meeting 3 this week! We will be recapping the last couple weeks as well as giving the final updates for the semester. It will be Wednesday at 7, and thelocation will be set by the end of the day Monday.\n\n3. Day Rallye on Sunday!\n\nDay Rallye Fall 2013\nWhen? Sunday November 24, 2013\nWhere: 9:00 AM @ Area 51, Driver's Meeting 9:15 AM, First Car Out 9:30 AM\n*Times are approximate, which is ironic when you consider the event...*\n\nWe're going down to K1 Karting! So bring money for as much karting as you want! Yes, it ends in Houston. Be ready for that. \n\nCome join us for a fun morning of driving aimlessly through town and the countryside! Rallyes are a great event for discovering the town, making stories, getting lost, and just plain having a good time. Plus there's a gathering at the end... so... yeah.\n\nWhat is this rallye business?\nOur rallyes are a Time Speed Distance rallye. You are given a set of coded directions (SSS = Straight at Stop Sign, R1 = First right, etc). Your objective is to make it through the directions. However, you also are trying to get through the directions to each of 3 checkpoints in the ideal amount of time (based on how far it is between checkpoints and what your average speed (CAST) is on those roads). THIS IS NOT A RACE. Getting there first doesn't make you the winner. Speeds are even set 5 MPH below the legal speed limit. You get points for every second early or late you are. Lowest score wins. This all sounds really complicated, but it's a blast. If you're new, don't worry. Just making it to the finish is quite an accomplishment and gives you a good shot at winning a trophy! There is an expert and novice class, so you won't be competing against people that have done this for 4 years. \n\nDown to business: What to bring?\nDriver: Full gas tank (be ready to drive at least 80 miles).\nNavigator: Clipboard, pen/pencil.\nAlso, you can pile in as many people as you want, or legally can, into your car!\n\nONLY EXPERT CLASS IS ALLOWED TO HAVE A GPS!\n\nPrices are (per car) Members $5, Non-Members $10. \n\nWe are going to have a private session, with a practice race, a qualifying race, and an actual race. Top 3 finishers will win a trophy. It will cost $60 per person.\n\nI need a headcount for this weekend! If you wish to participate in the karting please reply to this post, or go to the club discussion group and find the pinned thread there. \n\nMore details will come up as the week goes on!

If anyone wants to convoy there, go to our Facebook group (https://www.facebook.com/groups/2200384508/) and coordinate with people there. \n\n2. Rallye Friday! For those new to rallye, here is a link to the rules:(http://www.tamscc.org/forum/content.php?124-TAMSCC-Official-Rallye-Rules). First rallye should be easy, no natural progression or very difficult directions. The meeting place for the rallye start is still up in the air at the moment, as lot 51 might be packed with RV's by Friday. So we'll keep you posted on that, it'll most likely end up somewhere like the general services building on agronomy.
