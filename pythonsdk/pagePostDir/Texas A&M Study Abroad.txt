Despite being born without arms due to a birth defect, Mel\u00e9ndez learned to play the guitar with his feet. Mel\u00e9ndez began playing and singing in the Los Angeles area in 1985. On September 15, 1987, Mel\u00e9ndez had the opportunity to exclusively perform in front of Pope John Paul II and continues to impress others with his talent.\n\nTony has traveled across the United States and forty foreign countries, making countless television\nappearances, including The Today Show, Good Morning America, Geraldo, CBS This Morning, The Late\nShow with Arsenio Hall, 700 Club, Robert Schuller, and prime-time network specials for Variety Clubs and\nVery Special Arts. He also performed at The World Series, where he sang the National Anthem for the fifth\ngame of the 1989 series. Tony has had the opportunity to give four additional performances for the Pope, twice\nin the Vatican, once in the Pope's homeland of Poland, and once in Denver Colorado for World Youth Day\n1993. Along with television and major personal appearances, newspapers and magazine articles have covered\nhim through out the world. We are thrilled to have the opportunity to bring him to Aggieland. \n\nThe event is scheduled to take place on Thursday, September 20, 2012, in Texas A&M\u2019s Rudder Theatre\nComplex at 7pm. Tickets cost $10 and can be purchased at St. Mary's Catholic Church or through a LEBA officer. Tickets will be $15 at the door.

A recipient of the Brown-Rudder Award, she also participated in the Undergraduate Research Scholars program and served as co-founder for two social justice student groups, \u201cOne Love\u201d and \u201cOne Aggieland.\u201d\n\nFinalist interviews for the Marshall Scholarship took place at the British Embassy in Houston on November 8.  Manago will return to Houston to interview for the Rhodes Scholarship on November 18 and 19.  Taking place at the Federal Circuit Courthouse and at the home of former Rhodes Scholar and federal judge Keith P. Ellison, the two-day selection process will include a luncheon, a \u201ccocktail hour,\u201d and a 30-minute interview.\n\nTexas A&M University has produced seven Rhodes Scholars and five Marshall Scholars, the most recent being biochemistry and genetics major Nick Anthis for the Rhodes in 2005 and environmental design major Faye Hays for the Marshall in 2007.  In last year\u2019s competition, Biochemistry and Genetics major Kristin Carter was selected as a finalist for the Marshall Scholarship, and in 2009, Biochemistry and Genetics major Ella Doerge was selected as a finalist for the Rhodes.  \nFor further details, read the full story on the Honors and Undergraduate Research news feed: http://tamuhonors.wordpress.com/2011/11/14/manago-selected-as-finalist-for-rhodes-marshall-scholarships/. \n", "icon": "https://fbstatic-a.akamaihd.net/rsrc.php/v2/yD/r/aS8ecmYRys0.gif", "type": "link", "id": "19423426230_248512598540403", "status_type": "shared_story", "description": "Texas A&M University former student Bianca Manago has been selected as a finalist for both the Rhodes and Marshall Scholarships, the two most prestigious and highly-coveted academic scholarship..."}

All three programs are targeted to students from the fields of engineering, physics, chemistry, biology, earth sciences (geology) and related disciplines. \n\nRISE undergrads have the opportunity to work on cutting edge research projects at top research institutions (e.g., Max-Planck-Institutes) and universities in Germany. Students are paired with German PhD students in a unique mentoring partnership to ensure immediate integration into hands-on lab work and a built-in social network with an excellent opportunity to develop new technical skills. RISE participants receive a scholarship to cover living expenses. To learn more about RISE, please visit: http://www.daad.de/rise/en or email: rise@daad.de. \n\nRISE professional is designed for recent graduates, Master's and PhD students, and alumni of the RISE program who are matched with a well-known German company, where they gain insight into the professional applications of science and engineering and develop practical skills. Internships can last from one-and-a-half to six months. Similar to RISE, this program features a scholarship to cover living expenses. Online registration is currently available.
