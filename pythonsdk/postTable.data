Know your fireworks; Read the warning labels and performance descriptions before igniting.
Have a designated shooter to organize and shoot your family show.
Alcohol and fireworks do not mix. Save your alcohol for after the show.
Parents and caretakers should always closely supervise teens if they are using fireworks.
Parents should not allow young children to handle or use fireworks.
Fireworks should only be used outdoors.
Always have water ready if you are shooting fireworks.
Obey local laws. If fireworks are not legal where you live, do not use them.
Wear safety glasses whenever using fireworks.
Never relight a “dud” firework.  Wait 20 minutes and then soak it in a bucket of water.
Soak spent fireworks with water before placing them in an outdoor garbage can.
Never attempt to alter or modify consumer fireworks and use them only in the manner in which they were intended.
Report illegal explosives, like M-80s and quarter sticks, to the fire or police department.SNL1990SNL199010151590202837961,,,46957822960,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-07-04,,,0,,,Our campus is closed today for Independence Day but will reopen tomorrow.SNL1990SNL199010151590171127961,,,46957822960,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-07-04,,,10151590171102961,,,Have a happy and safe 4th of July!SNL1990SNL199010151587059077961,,,46957822960,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-07-02,,,0,,,Students at Texas A&M University- Texarkana have access to an environmentally-friendly fitness facility offering the latest in cardiovascular and strength-training equipment.  http://www.tamut.edu/Student-Life/Fitness%20Center/index.htmlSNL1990SNL199010151587036327961,,,46957822960,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-07-02,,,0,,,Summer I wraps up this week.

This symbol on your coffee means that the beverage that you are about to enjoy has been grown from farms that provided fair wages and safe working conditions for their employees.

It also means that the farmers abided by internationally monitored environmental standards and guarantees that the farmer received a fair price for the crop.

By buying fair trade, you are supporting farmers across the world in their endeavors to earn an equal share for their work.

There are a few reasons for that, but the main one being that Kevin and I have been starting our own Independent Game Developer company and just haven't had the time to come up with creative content for y'all. 

That being said, I'm going to try harder to come up with fresh content on the page and keep making y'all laugh when I can. In the meantime, check out our company's facebook page if you want.

The Batt put up their own video before us, and stole our event without giving the event creators the slightest bit of credit in their video.

This is the comment we left on the video link:

"Roger puts his name in the credits for making the video and fails to mention the TexasA&Memes page at all. We were the ones who organized the event and got everyone together. We shot our own footage to use from the event that we created and The Batt recorded their footage and uploaded it before we got ours up.

You didn't even bother mentioning any of the event organizers in your video. You didn't interview us. Our names and the name of the Memes page is nowhere to be found.

I would understand if this were purely a feature story, but you specifically titled it TAMU Harlem Shake AND you included the actual Harlem Shake video at the end. A feature story would cover basic information about the event, how it was set up, logistics involved, attendance, etc.

This video is clearly a Harlem Shake video disguised as a news story, not the other way around.

AVOID SLEEPING IN PUBLIC PLACES: The majority of crimes are crimes of opportunity, in which victims lack general awareness. Sleeping in common areas around campus, such as Evans Library, provides criminals an opportunity to take advantage of exhausted students. If you must rest your eyes, wrap your arms around your belongings or keep your belongings under your head like a pillow.

As such, if you choose to camp out for tickets, you must follow the regulations below, or risk being removed from the ticket line.  As in weeks past, if there are tickets available after all sports option holders have had their chance to pull tickets, we will sell leftovers.  Due to the high demand for these tickets, we will only be able to sell to students who DO NOT have the full football season sports pass (if you already have a ticket, you cannot get another using your student ID).  The ticket price for Alabama is $50 (non-student tickets, $100). 
 
 
Regulations for camping out:

1.     Camping out may not begin prior to 5:00 pm on the day prior to your class’ pull day.  If lining up for the sale of leftover tickets on Thursday, you many not line up before 9:30 am on Thursday.  This includes leaving personal belongings in the campout area to save a space.  Anything left as a space saver will be sent to the Lost and Found at the University Police office. 

2.     The official campout area will be the covered area between the Seibel Center and the Mary Moody Northen Student Center.  No one waiting for tickets should be inside either of these buildings.  There will be no loitering in the general camp-out area prior to the campout start times.

3.     For each place held in line, there must be 1 person at all times.  So, if you must leave your place to go get food, use the restroom, shower, go to work, etc., you must have someone come hold your place while you are gone.  A max of 10 tickets will be given to each position in line.

4.     Items such as fire pits will NOT be allowed at the campout area.  Use of the University’s electrical outlets is strictly prohibited.  Tents may not be so large as to completely block walkways/doorways.  If you are uncertain about any other campout items, please come to the Office of Student Life and ask.

5.     Faculty/Staff parking in the lot behind Seibel Center should not be used during the campout time, as you will not be out of the ticket line before 8 am, when faculty and staff arrive.  You will be ticketed.

6.     CLEAN UP YOUR MESS.  Leave no trace of your campsite.  Ticket pull will not begin until the campout area is cleaned up.SNL1990SNL199010151869368339533,,,32963389532,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-04,,,0,,,This is a Monthly Test of the Sea Aggie Alert System.

Monday: Seniors
Tuesday: Juniors and up
Wednesday: Sophomores and up
Thursday: Freshmen until noon; leftover tickets will be sold from 1:00 pm – 4:30 pm

Upperclassmen may pull up 1 underclassman season ticket holder on their designated day.

Leftover tickets are sold to students only – one ticket per ID.  If you are purchasing a ticket for a non-student to use, you will need to pay a guest ticket price, which is double that of a student ticket:

Guest ticket prices (tickets being used by students are ½ price, when a student ID is shown at Kyle Field):
Rice - $60
SHSU - $60
Alabama - $100
SMU - $60
Auburn - $80
Vanderbilt - $70
UTEP - $60
Miss State - $80
***There is no guarantee that guest tickets will be available for all games***

It is HIGHLY recommended that students hoping to purchase extra guest tickets pull their ticket on their designated day.  If you wait to pull your ticket while purchasing extras, your ticket may not be available.  When you come to purchase extra tickets, you can trade the ticket you pulled so that you will have two tickets together.  If you plan to make this trade, please be sure to keep your original ticket in good condition (do not fold up in a wallet or pocket).

BE SURE TO BRING YOUR STUDENT ID TO KYLE FIELD TO SHOW WITH YOUR TICKET, OR YOU WILL BE ASKED TO PURCHASE A GUEST PASS

Before a Hurricane

To begin preparing, you should build an emergency kit and make a family communications plan.

Know your surroundings.

Learn the elevation level of your property and whether the land is flood-prone. This will help you know how your property will be affected when storm surge or tidal flooding are forecasted.

Identify levees and dams in your area and determine whether they pose a hazard to you.

Learn community hurricane evacuation routes and how to find higher ground. Determine where you would go and how you would get there if you needed to evacuate.

Make plans to secure your property:

Cover all of your home’s windows. Permanent storm shutters offer the best protection for windows. A second option is to board up windows with 5/8” marine plywood, cut to fit and ready to install. Tape does not prevent windows from breaking.

Install straps or additional clips to securely fasten your roof to the frame structure. This will reduce roof damage.

Be sure trees and shrubs around your home are well trimmed so they are more wind resistant.

Clear loose and clogged rain gutters and downspouts.

Reinforce your garage doors; if wind enters a garage it can cause dangerous and expensive structural damage.

Plan to bring in all outdoor furniture, decorations, garbage cans and anything else that is not tied down.

Determine how and where to secure your boat.

Install a generator for emergencies.

If in a high-rise building, be prepared to take shelter on or below the 10th floor.

Consider building a safe room.

Hurricanes cause heavy rains that can cause extensive flood damage in coastal and inland areas. Everyone is at risk and should consider flood insurance protection. Flood insurance is the only way to financially protect your property or business from flood damage. To learn more about your flooding risk and how to protect yourself and your business, visit the Federal Insurance and Mitigation Administration (NFIP) Web site,www.floodsmart.gov or call 1-800-427-2419.SNL1990SNL199010151644284599533,,,32963389532,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-05-22,,,0,,,UTMB will be on campus holding a "Blood Drive"

According to city officials of West, Texas, donations of goods pouring into support the citizens of West are overwhelming and more than sufficient. Although extremely grateful for the willingness of people to help, local authorities ask that donations of unrequested goods stop. Lack of ability to coordinate and store donations taxes the ability of volunteers to assist where needed.

Yesterday 2/21/13 about 2:35pm, a dark colored truck (looks like a ford) occupied by two white males, came onto campus and stole a motorcycle from the new tennis court lot.  Please view the pictures of the suspects and contact the TAMUG Police Department if you have any information about this truck or these individuals. If you saw the truck or saw them loading the truck, please call the police immediately.  Any information we can get will be helpful.

Many at Texas A&M Galveston have been touched in some way by the tragic consequences of someone driving impaired.  On Wednesday, February 20 in the Student Center there will be a dual purpose demonstration to educate our community about dangers of driving intoxicated as well as the growing problem of “distracted driving” (texting while driving).  

Thanks to a generous grant from UTMB, there will be two simulators set up in the Student Center between 10:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. this Wednesday to demonstrate the effects of driving drunk and driving distracted.  There will be an educational presentation on driving impaired and/or distracted on Wednesday, February 20 at 1:00 p.m. in OCSB 142.  Everyone in the TAMUG community is welcome to attend both events.   

*According to the Bay Area Council on Drugs and Alcohol, 1547 is the number of deaths related drunk driving in 2011 in the state of Texas.SNL1990SNL199010151478070759533,,,32963389532,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-02-19,,,0,,,Former Students!

Questions? 

Call Debra Maceo at (409) 740-4915.SNL1990SNL199010151448591579533,,,32963389532,,,0,,,3,,,,,,2013-02-05,,,0,,,We are blessed to have a blending of many cultures here in the United States and what we find over time is many of the cultures add their own flavor to the "stew" that is American culture.  Hispanic, African American, Jamaican, Chinese, Irish, German, and many other cultures have brought their own influences to the point where sometimes the influence can become so prevalent in day to day culture; many people often do not even realize where the influence originally came from. Food is a huge part of that.  As a result, many institutions, particularly educational institutions, try to celebrate and point out the influences so people appreciate these cultures and their contributions to our society.

Soul food is one example of that.  There were many dishes that were developed by the slaves and introduced to the Americas as a result of the trans-Atlantic slave trade.  In addition many other dietary staples were developed by the slaves who were fed by their captors as cheaply and little as possible.  As a result, you often see menu items that utilize typically discarded meat (like pig's feet, oxtail, and ham hocks), used lard, cornmeal, and offal (like hushpuppies and deep fried foods) to bolster the filling, and supplemental items that could be found in small gardens (like collard greens, watermelons, wild garden items, etc.). These menu items, which started as a necessity, developed over time as families put their own spin and added their own flavoring.  Now soul food is a vital part of American cuisine that is celebrated around the world.  You can find restaurants around the world, and even here in Galveston, that specialize in soul food and African American cuisine.  We feel it is important to celebrate its origins and recognize the culture that brought us this fine food.  Our menu for Black History month was developed for this reason and was developed in conjunction with many of our staff who see this food as a point of pride.  It is also shared with the Office of Multicultural Education and Diversity in Student Life to ensure it fits as part of the educational program of Black History Month.

Saturday February 2

The Color Guard, Drill Team, and Honor Guard will march in the 2:00 P.M. Mystic Krewe of Aquarius Parade at 12 Noon in Galveston.  The parade will start at the corner of 14th street and Sea Wall Boulevard, and proceed to the corner of 59th Street and Sea Wall Boulevard.  What a venue for a Mardi Gras Parade – right next to the beach!  Come have fun at this event, and cheer on your fellow Sea Aggies!

Friday February 8

The Hearn Honor Guard, in their striking white uniforms will participate in the 17th annual San Luis Salute.  This Mardi Gras Gala according to event official Kim Schultz, will be hosted by Paige and Tilman Fertitta, and will offer entertainment, fashions, food galore, and an appearance by the Knights of Momus Court.  The Salute will benefit the new Jennie Sealy Hospital at the University of Texas Medical Branch in Galveston, and honor Dr. Ken Fujise, Professor and Chief of the UTMB Division of Cardiology and the John Sealy Centennial Chair of Medicine.

Friday February 8

The Texas Maritime Academy Drill Team and Color Guard will be in New Orleans for the annual Mardi Gras Drill Meet hosted by the Tulane University Naval ROTC Unit.  This is an annual competition of ROTC and Merchant Marine Cadets from throughout the nation.  Typical competitors include the United States Naval Academy, United States Military Academy, United States Air Force Academy, Norwich University, Virginia Tech University, The Citadel, The United States Merchant Marine Academy, and numerous universities from across the nation. 

This is not an easy competition, as each team’s performance is graded by the watchful eyes of Marine Corps evaluators who know all the details of marching, facing movements, ceremonial display of rifles, and proper presentation of our nation’s flag. Our team members have worked hard since the beginning of the fall 2012 semester so they can feel the pride associated with presenting our nation’s flag with honor and dignity as well as marching with crispness, and precision, and a desire for overall excellence.  They have also developed their roles as team members.  Whether our cadet members are upper classmen in leadership roles, or underclassmen eagerly learning from experienced  seniors, juniors, and sophomores, each member has matured in ways that will benefit them down the road, whether in the classroom, the boardroom, on board a waterborne vessel, or in any other place of employment. If you see our team members, be sure to wish them well, as they will be our university’s ambassadors at this grueling competition. 

Tuesday February 12 (Fat Tuesday)

The Drill Team, Color Guard, and Honor Guard, as guests of the Mystic Krewe of Aquarius, will again lead this year’s Fat Tuesday Parade on the Strand in Galveston.  The parade is scheduled to kick off at 6:30 P.M. at the Corner of 25th Street and Santa Fe Place Street, proceed through the streets of downtown and end where it started.

TAMIU students must have a thorough understanding of the University’s standards for academic integrity. Presenting another’s words or ideas as your own (intentionally or unintentionally) is plagiarism and constitutes a serious offense. 
 
13 basic tips to avoid claims of dishonesty:
 
1.  Eat and sleep well before final exam.
2.  Review your course syllabus, including any special assignment from your instructor.
3.  Be on time for final exam.
4.  Be prepared with materials (blue book, scantron, pencil, pens, etc.). Avoid taking additional items not approved by instructor. 
5.  Do not look around, particularly in the direction of other students’ paper, during an exam since it may appear you are trying to copy from others.
6.  When taking an exam, shield your answer sheet. If you feel someone is trying to copy from you, ask your proctor if you may move. This will alert the proctor to a potential problem and help remove suspicion from you as aiding the other student if a claim of cheating arises.
7.  Protect your computer log-in identification and passwords. Other students could use them to access your work and subsequently implicate you in a cheating case.
8.  Check with your instructor before turning in a paper or project you submitted in another course.
9.  Do not give your homework, papers, projects, or other assignments to other students. They may use parts of your work as their own.
10.  When completing take-home exams, do not collaborate with other persons unless approved by the instructor.
11.  Safe guard rough drafts and copies of papers submitted in courses since other students may get access to your work and claim it as their own.
12.  Safe guard pin drives and other electronic devices. Students may borrow information and submit as their own.
13.  Ensure the correct submission of work. Avoid saving assignments with same name. If you submit incorrect assignment, inform your instructor immediately.

I'd like to say a few words:

Sometimes this may seem meaningless, purposeless, you may be asking yourself, "Why? Why am I struggling with school? What will this do in return for me?" 

Don't get caught up in that. Education is the most inherent form of value that exists, even more so than physical currency. You are adding value to yourself. So work hard and persevere, this is the surest path to greatness and prosperity that exists in the world, and many a citizen of the world would love to be in your place right now. Work hard, and overcome every obstacle that presents itself to you. You all are a capable, intelligent bunch of people. Greatness lies in all of us. Don't ever forget that.

So, I wish you all the best of luck. Work your ass off, position yourself for success, and you WILL be rewarded.SNL1990SNL1990278612678972538,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-12-07,,,0,,,Mackensie is so frigging adorable.

You're one of the shorter girls who works there, and you usually have your hair up in a high ponytail that's way too cute, and you have that one stripe running in your bangs that absolutely gets me every time I see you. Definitely have that punk rocker vibe going on, and it's like being able to see music just to look at you.

I still don't know your name, I'm absolute shit with names, although I've been going to your Freebirds since I moved up here. But every time I come into the place if you're there there's always this really brief moment when we both make eye contact and exchange these little smiles, and you always seem to rush to be the one who makes my food. I always want to say something, anything, but being surrounded by people makes it hard. I do my best to act smooth even though I'm not, give you a big smile, ask how your day was going, and try to get a laugh or two out of you because I know that your days are probably hectic, but I'm never sure if you're acting in kind or if it's just good customer service.

I'm sure that I'm just another guy in the crowd to you with how busy your location always is, but in all honesty that little smile you give me when I walk in is part of the reason I go there so often. There's no telling if you'll ever read this, or if you'll ever know who I am if you do, or even if you do figure it all out if you're single in the first place, but just know that ever since I moved up here I've met a lot of girls and none of them compare to you. I only regret that I can't get to know you better in the few moments we get to exchange small talk.

I'm taking a bit of a risk here, but if it helps any I always order the same thing. Two tacos, both spanish rice, both refried beans, one steak and one dark chicken, lettuce and tomato, and then ranch on the chicken and salsa on the steak. I don't even think I've given you my name, but you might have seen it on the name tag I wear in most of the time, and I can't really say it here, but hopefully that will be enough. I know you asked me once if I wanted ""the usual.""

It's just not in me to try and talk to you about anything other than your day in the middle of such a big crowd, and I don't want to embarrass you in front of your coworkers, but if you can recognize me, and if those little smiles are more than just good customer service, maybe one of these times I come in you might be able to slip me your number, or maybe even catch me before I leave the place."SNL1990SNL1990270143656486107,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-11-16,,,0,,,To anyone who has been the subject of a post, did you ever meet your stalker *cough* secret admirer?SNL1990SNL1990269986493168490,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-11-16,,,0,,,There's this guy in my Blinn math class on MWF at 9:00 and he's seriously the most attractive guy I've seen in a long time.

I've tried to work up the courage to talk to you again, but I've always chickened out at the last second.  When I do manage to do it, I can only come up with lame excuses as to why.

Exhausted, worn, and wooly
A haven awaits for me
A place to help one flee
And relax peacefully

Dreaming beyond reality
Epitomizing oneself
As I lie by myself
Regaining vitality

Oh how wondrous to transcend
To rest and close my eyes
Yet the sun must rise
And the dream shall end

My body twist and turn
Can’t I spend one more hour?
To succumb to thy power
Why must I return?

So wait for me, oh bed
I yearn to repose
I only wish to doze
I’d rather be with thee insteadSNL1990SNL1990268166540017152,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-11-11,,,0,,,Matt Dorsey, you are in my Blinn Speech class on M/W/F mornings....

Just keep in mind that someone really liked the way you smiled/laughed.

P.S. It's strange that you asked me if the annex let you rent headphones to which I replied in affirmative and then you didn't even get any headphone.

She sat down perpendicular to me in the group of couches closest to the piano. I haven’t been able to get her out of my mind since that afternoon (if I remember right, it was already dark outside, but I could be wrong) and I haven’t seen her since. She was a relatively short (couldn’t have been taller than 5’5”) and thin Hispanic girl with her black hair in a single braid. She was wearing black running shorts and a Class of 2017 Howdy shirt that was sold at all the NSCs this past summer. She was on her laptop (I think it was black or gray) listening or watching something with a white pair of headphones on. She nuzzled herself into the couch after she sat down and I thought it was the most adorable thing I had ever seen. I spend a lot of my time as a freshman in the flag room, and I really hope that I can see the girl who left before I could talk to her that afternoon again so I can have the chance to meet her.SNL1990SNL1990264250087075464,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-11-01,,,0,,,To the beautiful 5'10" Girl who pulled tickets this morning at 7AM (Wednesday) wearing yellow athletic shorts, green shirt, and converse like shoes w/umbrella.

I haven't been able to ask a girl on a date since my ex, and that was three years ago. I'm probably one of the shiest guys ever and I don't even think I'm that attractive anyway. That's why I struggle talking to pretty girls. Even with the help of alcohol, I'm still pretty hopeless.

Admin edit: Guy, ^that attitude right there, will not win you points with her, but then again from what I see this isn't your biggest life issue at the moment.  You have a confidence problem.  Bear in mind something right now.  You're awesome and you're lucky as hell.  From the time you were born you were awesome.  How do I know this?  You beat millions and millions of other little swimmers to your mama's egg at conception.  You could be any other species of creature on any planet ever and you get to be a person.  Not just any person, no you were made for more than that; you are a person in the 21st century, going to one of the best universities in the state, in the country.  Rather than holding Amy on a pedestal, (no offense to you, you're awesome also), talk to any one of the other THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS of girls on this campus.  Statistically speaking one of these girls is bound to talk to you, as awesome as you are.  Afterall, you're awesome. 

P.S. you don't need alcohol to talk to females, you're awesome enough sober.  You just gotta tap into that inner awesome.

One of them is apologizing to an old friend..who is also my ex. Not trying to get back with him (that won't happen) but I just don't want to look back and have his last memory of me be something really negative because it currently is..
I see him on campus all the time and have a class with him. I would love to just walk up to him and see if he wanted to grab coffee or something one day to talk it out but I'm scared to and he runs away when he sees me. Not literally, but may as well.
I just want to apologize for being so stupid and immature when I was younger and maybe catch up. I want to see how his job search is going, and classes, and his family, and Corps stuff.
And yes I am pussying out and asking on the confessions page. If someone knows him tag him.
His name is Reed Parker, he's a senior in the corps, from Southlake, idk what outfit/staff he is in anymore though. But I know he has friends on this page! Tag him y'all

So, as you guys may or may not know, this page is censored. The parameters of the censorship are kind of opaque, and some submissions are just boring. So I won't post them. I post about 65% of whatever is submitted.

So-Here's the idea! For a 48 hour period, this Saturday and Sunday we will have unfiltered crushes, confessions, etc. Whatever you submit will be posted, and the page will be updated ever 2-3 hours so that your newsfeed won't clog. We want you to express your feelings on things regardless of controversy, etc. So start posting. Sat/Sun

tl;dr THIS PAGE WILL BE UNFILTERED AND UPDATED EVERY 3 HOURS THIS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY 9/21-22. WE WILL POST EVERYTHING, NO HOLDS BARRED AT ALL.

One more point- Guys who contacted me about being an admin of this page whom I didn't respond to. I will be putting in place a team of 3 or 4 people to facilitate the postings ever 3/4 hours. If you're interested message me again. I will probably message you guys back about this as well.

Tell your friends, because this is going to be interesting.

Admin- (Just a neutral party here) Even if it's spread really thin, the racism exists. And this is just an example.SNL1990SNL1990240066446160495,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-17,,,0,,,to the desperate indian guy - 

i am an indian girl. you are embarrassing everyone from india. please get over yourself and get your head out of your butt. just cause you're brown and go to a school with a lot of white people, doesn't mean that you are going to be single forever or that all the girls hate you. 

you got a nice comment from the white girl (not trying to be racist... but i dont know who you are), but now you're getting a blunt one from a brown girl. GET OVER YOURSELF. crying on this is just making you look lamer and lamer - if you think that you're not "good enough" for a white girl, then you probably aren't. that actually made me cringe writing it... when the heck does one have to be "good enough" for something like race? i mean probably not since civil rights. 

anyways.... point of my rant is: STOP POSTING ON HERE. if you're that desperate, download tinder or better yet, talk to white girls... heck even the green ones! talk to all colors cause color shouldnt matter!SNL1990SNL1990240063356160804,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-17,,,0,,,No day is "Sunny" without you.I still remember very vividly the first time I saw you.It was at the I-buffet this spring.My heart pounded faster than it ever had when I saw you for the first time.I have tried many times to confront you and admit the feelings that I have developed over the last few months,but I couldn't muster the courage to do so.I know

I see him in ECEN602 class. I don't know anything about him, just got his name somehow. Wonder if we can go for a coffee. 

Admin-This is fake as hell.SNL1990SNL1990240032512830555,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-17,,,0,,,To the famous "desperate Indian guy" on here: I am a "white" girl, which I just see as 'my parents happen to have ancestors from Ireland, Germany, Holland, and others.' My boyfriend of three years happens to have been born in India and has a beautiful brown skin tone and a sexy accent, but what I really love about him is his personality, intelligence, creativity, selflessness and most important of all: the chemistry that we have between each other, which neither of us have ever felt for anyone else.

That being said, I think YOU are the one being a racist. People are more than their heritage, it's what's inside your brain that makes who you really are. If you haven't found a girlfriend is not "because you're Indian and Texas A&M women are racist," but maybe because you don't care about who the girl really is like, but merely that she looks cute enough for you. There are thousands of cute girls on campus, but have you maybe tried looking for a compatible one? Regardless of her looking "European" or "Latin American," have you tried looking for someone who shares your passions? It also seems to me that if you just want whichever pretty girl happens to pay attention to you then you are probably not ready to be with someone, and girls can sense that very quickly. 

I've given this advice to many of my so-called "desperate" friends (male and female) who have been constantly looking for someone and see being single as some kind of curse: Don't try to look for someone that "makes you happy" or "someone that completes you," but learn how to be happy with yourself first! Only then will you find out who you really are and the right kind of partner will sense that right away. Only then you will know what you're actually looking for in a girlfriend. Plus, this makes things better for you if things don't work out and you become single again, as long as you keep your confidence and a clear sense of identity. You are who you want to be! So make yourself be someone that you are happy with and then you can worry about sharing this awesome self with a potential female partner, whose mind you can fall in love with. This does NOT mean be what TV says guys should be, nor be  what a particular kind of girl likes, but be who YOU are comfortable being! Follow your conscience, listen to your brain! Be who you really are!

Also keep in mind that It's very hard to be happy with someone if you're already unhappy being single, so don't go into a relationship looking to become happy through it. If you do then you will likely just become clingy and scare her away very fast! I hope you see this and I hope this helps, good luck!!!SNL1990SNL1990240031976163942,,,232794586887681,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-17,,,0,,,Riley Greenberg, I think you are absolutely beautiful.

Also, since the volume of crushes is so heavy that I would clog your newsfeeds if I posted 100% of them, would you guys follow a twitter account where I would post the most creepy excess crushes?

One more thing: I'm considering finding another person to help me post these since the volume is significant. Message me if you'd like to help.

Our frontman Carlos Hicks has had some charges pending against him for some time now for something we won't elaborate on. 

Today he was sentenced to 18 months in prison due to an unfortunate event. Needless to say this has forced him to step down has frontman for this band.

From the bottom of all our hearts we wish you and your family all the best for the future brother, things may not look so bright right now but before you know it you will be back with your daughter, girlfriend and family. I really hope that you are somehow able to read this from in there..

We would like to welcome the great Rheese Peters (ex The Endless pandemic) to our band as frontman. We will be releasing a brand new track this Sunday titled "SATAN'S UPHEAVAL" from our upcoming debut album "THE GOD DELUSION" so get your ears ready for this.

The program is a diversity initiative to identify promising leaders in their communities and in the legal profession.

This year’s class includes six Former Students among its twenty members:

Adam C. Falco ’03, Senior Assistant City Attorney in the College Station City Attorney’s Office,

Donald Delgado ’05, Associate, West, Webb, Allbrittion & Gentry, P.C.,

Marcos Rosales ’05, Associate, Beck Redden LLP,

Ben Whitehill ’07, Associate, Sprouse Shrader Smith, PC,

Chris Kang ‘04, Associate, Haynes and Boone, LLP,

Melissa Kates ’99, Shareholder, Underwood Law Firm, P.C.

Participants examine what is expected of leaders and, with the advice and guidance of current leaders, discover how to best engage in public involvement to be effective in the legal profession and in the community. The yearlong program consists of two training sessions and concludes with the presentation of group projects during the State Bar of Texas Annual Meeting.

The long-range goal of LeadershipSBOT is to develop leaders in the legal profession that more closely reflect the state’s demographics.SNL1990SNL1990658528504172307,,,445538375471322,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-19,,,0,,,Complete list of the 12 Under 12 Spotlight Recipients! https://t.co/1Q0ltgB1l3SNL1990SNL1990658026377555853,,,445538375471322,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-18,,,0,,,With all of the great stores about @TAMU the last few days, it's been easy to remember why we love our school and are proud to be Aggies!SNL1990SNL1990657584814266676,,,445538375471322,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-09-17,,,10151736909613172,,,Good Bull!

"In this season of giving, I think about those who have giving me so much, and how thankful I am—thankful for the opportunities and experiences that have made my time at Texas A&M so rich.

Every Friday night, we serve dozens of students a delicious Shabbat dinner.  Every night, we provide a comfortable place for students to study for their next exam.  Every day, we provide Jewish students with a place to call home away from home and a place to socialize and identify with our faith community.  We give support to our students seeking help for a myriad of issues issues as they transition to adulthood.
 
You are the Texas A&M community, and you make efforts like these possible every day.
 
Now, I'm writing to ask you about tomorrow.  There are many students who continually seek our support; there are many Jewish Aggies on campus who need the comfort, care and inspiration only we can provide - and the number increases daily as we expand our services to Jewish students on the Texas A&M campus.
 
Please help now: Make a year-end tax-deductible contribution to Texas A&M Hillel today - http://tamuhillel.org/a/invest-in-us/donate-now/

Tony Garza, of Falfurrias, Texas, originally from Cotulla, won the Lone Star Conference 100-yard dash title in 1961 with a record time of 9.4.  That mark still stands as the conference record.  He was inducted into the Texas A&I Javelina Hall of Fame in 1976.
Garza also held the LSC 220-yard dash and 100-meter dash records for years and ran on the 1960 Texas A&I mile relay team that won the LSC gold medal.
He was a member of the “T” Association and HPE Club.
Tony served as an instructor and director of the Upward Bound program at Texas A&I and is now enjoying retirement in Falfurrias, TX where he resides with his wife Dora who is also a Texas A&I Alum.  Since '08, both Tony and Dora have served and continue to serve as proud board members of the Texas A&I Alumni Association.

James R. McIntire, a.k.a. "Mr. Mac" was a Business Executive, Professor and advisor at Texas A&I University.  He is fondly remembered by the many lives he changed not only inside the classroom, but especially outside the classroom. Whether working in his office, relaxing at home with his wife "Mrs. Mac," or having a cold beer at Skee's, he always had or made time for enthusiastic young people trying to find their place in this world. His council was invaluable. In addition to teaching at A&I, he was also the advisor to the Sigma Chi chapter on campus which he guided.  The chapter is still active on campus to this day. A homecoming 2013 scholarship has been dedicated in his memory through the Alumni of Texas A&I.

Laura Canales (August 19, 1954 – April 16, 2005) was an American Tejano musician and an original inductee in the Tejano Roots Hall of Fame. Laura was born and raised in Kingsville.
She attended Henrietta M. King High School, where she was well known for her remarkable vocals. After graduation, her father, Perfecto, encouraged her to continue her pursuit of a tejano music career. She made her recording debut in 1973 with Los Unicos while simultaneously singing with renowned Texas conjunto and norteño group Conjunto Bernal.
In the mid-1970s, Canales was a founding member of tejano band Snowball & Company, which also went by the name, Felicidad. The band released several full-length albums and singles.

In 1981, Canales married drummer Balde Muñoz and formed the group Laura Canales & Encanto. After signing with Freddie Records, the group enjoyed enormous success. The group's single, Sí Viví Contigo, was their first major hit. In 1983, Texas Governor Mark White honored her with the Yellow Rose of Texas Award, the state's highest honor for artists. From 1983 to 1986, Canales won both best female entertainer and female vocalist honors at the Tejano Music Awards, a record that stood until Selena broke it in the 1990s. In 1987, Canales did a cover of José José's Te Quiero Asi with Mazz's Joe Lopez which appeared on the band's album Beyond.
In 1989, Canales and Balde Muñoz divorced. Canales subsequently quit Encanto and went into semi-retirement. She did manage a comeback during a surge in international popularity of Tejano music during the early 1990s. As a solo artist, this comeback yielded several well-known hits, including Cuatro Caminos, Dame La Mano, and Dile a Tu Esposa.
Eventually, Laura began preparing for life beyond Tejano music. Remembering a promise to her mother, she enrolled in classes at Texas A&I University. Canales graduated with Bachelor's degrees in Psychology and Speech Therapy in 1997. Shortly thereafter, Canales began taking graduate classes at Texas A&I, working toward a Master's degree in Communication Science Disorders. During her breaks from university coursework, Canales began yet another comeback by participating with the Leyendas y Raices Tour which included fellow Tejano performers Carlos Guzman, Augustin Ramirez, Sunny Ozuna, Freddie Martinez, Mario Montes, and Grupo Sierra. In 2000, Canales became part of the first class of inductees to the Tejano Roots Hall of Fame.
It was while attending graduate school at A&I that Laura first began experiencing problems with her gall bladder. After undergoing routine gall bladder surgery, Canales developed a case of pneumonia and died suddenly on April 16, 2005.SNL1990SNL1990521035757979086,,,105816052834394,,,0,,,1,,,,,,2013-09-13,,,521035751312420,,,Javelinas play tomorrow at AT&T (Cowboys) Stadium in Arlington.

Carlos Guerra, a graduate of Texas A&I University and a former columnist for the San Antonio Express-News was a civil rights activist, grants writer and fundraiser.

Carlos was an outspoken advocate for increased access to higher education, environmental issues and Latino participation in government and politics. A journalist for many years, he joined the San Antonio Light in 1991 as a columnist. When the paper folded two years later, he was hired by the Express-News, and his face and prose quickly became a staple of the Metro section. His last column was published Sept. 12, 2009.

"He was a fierce advocate for better education opportunities for Mexican Americans," Rivard continued, "and other underserved communities long before such system reforms became a common cause."

At the time of his death, Guerra was in the midst of reinventing himself in the public relations field, several friends said.

Before his death, Guerra was front and center at an event in which he was roasted and toasted in the name of a scholarship fund named for him, to be endowed at his alma mater, Texas A&I University. More than $10,000 had been raised for scholarships that will benefit first-generation South Texas college students, a cause close to him.

A youth leader in the early days of the Chicano civil rights movement, Guerra was born in Robstown.

His father was an educator. His mother was believed to be one of the first Hispanic graduates of Texas A&I University.

"We always looked at Carlos as a role model," Velasquez said. "From the days at A&I, he always had an interest in the history of Tejanos. He knew our history,"

"At A&I, he was a very outspoken leader on campus," said Compean, and he was regarded as controversial for speaking publicly about racism, segregation and housing discrimination in Kingsville and on campus.

That gained him a distinction: "He was burned in effigy."

"He was a public intellectual," Cotrell said. "He understood the urban system well and the political underpinnings of San Antonio and South Texas."

"He spoke to urban issues that effected minorities," Velasquez said, adding that Carlos also had "a story for everything."SNL1990SNL1990519280791487916,,,105816052834394,,,0,,,541,,,,,,2013-09-09,,,519280778154584,,,Hey Hoggies!

Lieutenant General Ricardo Sanchez was born in Rio Grande City, Texas (Starr County) in 1953.  At the age of 20, he graduated from Texas A&I University (Class of '73)  with a double major in mathematics and history. 
In 1991, then Lieutenant Colonel Sanchez served as a battalion commander during Operation Desert Storm.  Shortly after the Gulf War, Sanchez was promoted to Colonel.  He later went on to become a general.  
From June of 2003 to June of 2004, Sanchez held the top military position in Iraq during what was arguably one of the most critical periods of the war—the year after the fall of the Hussein regime, and the time the insurgency took root and began its counterattack.

Longoria, 38, spent the last three years studying and taking classes in person to earn this graduate degree.  Longoria wrote her thesis on "Success STEMS From Diversity: The Value of Latinas in STEM Careers."  "'You're never too old or too busy to continue your education!" she added.  Longoria celebrated her successes the same way most students tend to do, going out to dinner after the ceremony with her very proud parents: Enrique Longoria, Jr. and Ella Eva Mireles.

Unfortunately, this moment ended with the last graduating class of Texas A&I University on August 6, 1993.  At that time, several companies made several different versions of the Texas A&I Javelina Ring.  However, in 1993, the A&M Board of Regents unexpectedly changed our university's name from Texas A&I University to the current name today, and the tradition of the Javelina ring, along with many other A&I Traditions, changed accordingly and sadly some were lost forever.
The Texas A&I Ring was one of the most symbolic of Javelina traditions. 
Traditionally, students wore their ring their senior year, just as the Texas A&I University graduate was ready to face the world.SNL1990SNL1990489030387846290,,,105816052834394,,,0,,,1,,,,,,2013-07-08,,,489030381179624,,,**A TEXAS A&I JAVELINA You Should Know**

Here's a little inspirational quote from the movie, "The Emperor's Club."  
A great teacher has little external history to record. His life goes over into other lives. These men are pillars in the intimate structure of our schools. They are more essential than its stones or beams, and they will continue to be a kindling force and a revealing power in our lives.SNL1990SNL1990470642059685123,,,105816052834394,,,0,,,40,,,,,,2013-05-29,,,470642039685125,,,This week we salute Young's Pizza in Kingsville, TX.   Roy and Margo Young opened Young's Root Beer Drive-In in 1956.  Customers were eager from the word go and in 1958, Young's became the first pizza place in town by adding the hot item to its menu.  Roy and Margo's son, Danny, came home from military duty in 1966 and began to run the business.  He changed the name to Young's Pizza and added several hot sandwiches to the menu.  Young's was also one of the first places in town to serve submarine sandwiches at that time.  In 1971, Scott Conard began working for Young's as a delivery boy.  He was quick and eager to learn and moved up to manager in less than two years.  He bought into the business as partner in 1975 when Danny moved to Austin, and in 1977, they decided to relocate Young's to it's present day location at 625 W. Santa Gertrudis.  Scott bought the place in 1980.  In 1985, the property Young's Pizza occupied was purchased from Joel Cavazos, another local businessman.  The latest change to the business came in the mid 90's when Scott and his wife Claudia incorporated Young's Pizza.  Young's has had several other "firsts" in its very diverse history.  "Hot Patooties, Frozen Yogurt," and "Gyros" came to Kingsville via Young's.  The history of Young's wouldn't be complete without mentioning the "Texicali," a submarine created by Danny young in the early 70's.  Young's Pizza has the honor of being the "Birthplace of the Texicali."  Since 1956, Young's has been known for its quality food and quality service, and  their employees today strive to keep that goal strong.  Young's takes great pride in their work, their community, and will always work to find new and better ways to serve YOU!   On any given day, you can find members of the Texas A&I Alumni Association enjoying a Texicali...or two!

Gilbert "Gil" Erwin Steinke (May 3, 1919 – May 10, 1995) was the head coach of the Texas A&I University Javelinas football team after having played at A&I then professionally in the NFL for the Philadelphia Eagles. He was born May 3, 1919 in Brenham, Texas and died May 10, 1995 in Austin, Texas. 
After graduating from high school in the coastal town of Ganado, Texas, Steinke began his football career as a player at Texas A&I, where he won all-conference honors on offense and defense. Steinke played with the Philadelphia Eagles from 1945–1948 and led the NFL in punt returns with a 14.8 average in 1947. As a starting safety, he helped the Eagles win a world title in 1948. After coaching in the high school ranks and at Oklahoma State, Trinity and Texas A&M, Steinke returned to his alma mater to become the athletic director and head football coach at Texas A&I University from 1954-1976. He directed A&I to 39 consecutive triumphs and six NAIA football national titles, including three in a row from 1974-1976. By the end of his 23-year coaching career at Texas A&I, he had achieved 10 Lone Star Conference championships and 186 wins against only 62 losses and 4 ties. Steinke was inducted into the Texas Sports Hall of Fame in 1977 and the College Football Hall of Fame in 1996. Later he tried his hand at coaching a professional team with the United States Football League's San Antonio Gunslingers in the mid-1980s.

Steinke was one of the early proponents of integrating Southern football. He was well known for walking out of restaurants and motels that would not take blacks and whites, and bringing on lots of black and Hispanic players regardless of social or financial status. "We integrated football in Texas," Steinke told the Houston Chronicle in 1989. "We had Sid Blanks (later a Houston Oiler) before anyone else integrated."

On May 16, 2013, a story in the sports section in the Express News titled "Redskins great Green: ‘I’m 100 percent for the Cowboys" was published.  
The story's about Houston's very own Texas A&I Javelinas great/Washington Redskins legend, and Pro Football Hall of Famer, Darrell Green on the possibility of his son Jared possibly becoming a member of the Dallas Cowboys.  He was quoted: “I am for Jared Green, that’s who I am for. If Jared is with the Cowboys, I am 100 percent for the Cowboys. Done. End of story. Nothing else to be said.  Jared’s got his work cut out for him, Darrell Green said of his son. "He just has to keep busting his butt like his daddy did at A&I.”
All of us in the Texas A&I Alumni Association wish Darrell and the entire Green Family all the best.SNL1990SNL1990465646003518062,,,105816052834394,,,0,,,2,,,,,,2013-05-17,,,465645993518063,,,Today we tip our "ten gallon" hats to all of our Texas A&I Javelinas living and working in the greater San Antonio area.

The Honorable Filemon Vela, United States Congressman serving the 34th District of Texas, spoke at our 4 p.m. commencement yesterday (05/10/13) in Kingsville.   He did an outstanding job.  The greatest parts of his speech came when he spoke about his family and the importance of Texas A&I University.
Over and over, he repeatedly drove home the name, "TEXAS A&I" to all those at the ceremony.  Congressman Vela is no stranger to South Texas.  He was born in Harlingen and raised in Brownsville. He graduated from Georgetown University and then went on to earn a Juris Doctorate from the University of Texas Law School.  All of us Alumni of Texas A&I truly appreciate the message he delivered at commencement.

James A. Crumley (Oct. 12, 1939 – Sept. 17, 2008), originally of Three Rivers, TX, played football for the Javelinas and received a B.A. degree with a major in history in 1964 from A&I.  He was the author of violent hard-boiled crime novels and several volumes of short stories and essays, as well as published and unpublished screenplays. He has been described as "one of modern crime writing's best practitioners", who was "a patron saint of the post-Vietnam private eye novel" and a cross between Raymond Chandler and Hunter S. Thompson. His book The Last Good Kiss has been described as "the most influential crime novel of the last 50 years."
In 2007, the magazine Men's Journal named The Last Good Kiss as number 12 on its list of "Top 15 Thrillers of All Time", and in Newsweek, George Pelecanos, crime author and co-producer of the HBO series The Wire, rated Crumley's The Last Good Kiss as #3 in his list of the "Five Most Important Crime Novels".
The detective "Crumley" in Ray Bradbury's trilogy of mystery novels (Death Is a Lonely Business, A Graveyard for Lunatics, and Let's All Kill Constance) is named in tribute to him.   James is one Texas A&I Javelina we dearly miss...

While we have been diligently preparing to well represent the TAMU Entomology Department in our effort for national master debater domination, we would really appreciate your help!  Please come to help us out on Tuesday, October 22nd at 3 pm in HEEP 413.  We will be giving our 7 minute presentation and a presentation on what we think might be the other team's argument (based on the citations they have given us).

"This image may look like something dreamed up for a surreal horror movie, but it's a real horror for the tarantula in question. This unfortunate arachnid is infected with Cordyceps, a parasitic fungus that replaces its host's tissue with its own.
 
Cordyceps fungi invades its hosts (mainly arthropods), and its mycelium eventually replaces the host's tissue. Once the arthropod is dead, cylindrical or branching growths emerge from the creature's dead body. Some species also have mind-control capabilities, convincing the host to travel to a place where the fungus will find optimal growth conditions before the host dies."SNL1990SNL1990338909446230459,,,11857793194,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-03-01,,,0,,,Congratulations Ph.D. Students Alison Bockoven and Meaghan Pimsler on becoming this year's Outstanding Graduate Students!!! https://insects.tamu.edu/feature/2013gradstudentawards/index.phpSNL1990SNL199010151332304708195,,,11857793194,,,0,,,2,,,,,,2013-02-20,,,10151332304628195,,,Come join our entomology students as they collect insects at Lake J.B.

Mosley ’39, who is almost 96-years-old and is living in Santa Fe, New Mexico. Mr. Mosley is a Word War II veteran and is one of the only living survivors of the 87 Aggies who served in the Philippines.

During the war, Mr. Mosely was captured by the Japanese and heroically survived the Bataan Death March in April 1942, where he was later held at the infamous Cabanatuan prisoner of war camp, and was then transferred to the POW camp in Mukden, Manchuria in October 1942—where he remained until liberated at the war's end on August 20, 1945. 

In an effort to raise the morale of the POW camp, Mr. Mosely illustrated the camp newsletter, similar to that of his 1938 Battalion illustration, which depicts a cadet traveling home for the holidays. Blanketed in snow and wrapped in an overcoat and scarf while puffing on a pipe with one hand in his pocket and the other outreached in a familiar “Gig ‘em” sign, the cadet patiently thumbs a ride home. The Aggie “Gig ‘em” moniker and hand-sign, already popularized in 1938, was also a common gesture for hitch-hiking, or thumbing, which was a common method of transportation for Texas A&M students in the 1920s through 1960s.

The Al Lowman Printing Arts Collection in Cushing Library is one of our greatest assets and reflects Al's many years of collecting fine printing, bibliography, book design, and the history of the book, especially in Texas and the Southwest.  In tribute to his life and his life's work in books, we plan to dedicate this year's Book History Workshop to his memory and will also be acquiring a book—a suitably outstanding example of fine presswork—to add to his collection.

Al was a man with a great sense of humor, as is evident in his obituary:SNL1990SNL1990517558211625220,,,102337189813993,,,0,,,0,,,,,,2013-04-18,,,0,,,Baylor Libraries reflects on the tragedy in West, Texas and the importance of historical preservation.

When the first notes sounded on the new Sharkey-Corrigan pipe organ at TAMIU on July 23, 2006, they signaled the arrival of the largest philanthropic gift ever in support of the arts in Laredo.

The organ, which weighs approximately 35,000 pounds, has 69 ranks and 52 stops. It has 3,998 pipes arranged in 69 sets or ranks, four keyboards and pipes in three locations. 

The $1.2 million organ, which took more than three years to plan and construct, is a gift of The E.H. Corrigan Foundation.

The concert features the Chamber Orchestra of Laredo and the TAMIU Chamber Singers joined by members of the Laredo Philharmonic Chorale. Also included on the program is the "Variations on a theme of Tchaikovsky" by Anton Arensky.

Around the corner in the CFPA Theatre, the Ballet Folklórico present Primavera Mexicana at 7 p.m.
