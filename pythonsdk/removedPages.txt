The Facebook environment allows for fan-driven interaction in ways that a normal website never could and allows us to get news, media and events that you might enjoy to you directly.  We love sharing little tidbits that we find interesting with you.  However, in an effort to keep our Facebook presence as fun and entertaining as possible, the staff will watch wall posts and comments for messages that solicit the time or money of our Facebook fans, are defamatory or harmful to an individual or group, or promote misinformation.  In addition, we cannot allow any posts or comments that constitute a potential violation of NCAA rules.  We also ask that any discussion or post be relevant somehow to varsity sports at Texas A&M University.  Any wall posts that fall outside of these guidelines will be subject to deletion.\n\nWe accept requests from groups wishing to promote their events within our Facebook fan base, and evaluate them on a case-by-case basis.  Anyone wishing to submit a request may e-mail the web staff at webadmin@athletics.tamu.edu.\n\nWhile all these rules sound counter-intuitive to the concept of social media and the free internet, we hope you understand that our reasoning is mostly to keep the information you receive accurate, the method entertaining, and the NCAA Rules Committee happy.", "talking_about_count": 6328, "cover": {"source": "https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/t1.0-9/s720x720/1922131_10152309505391800_11169209_n.jpg", "cover_id": "10152309505391800", "offset_x": 0, "offset_y": 0}, "location": {"city": "College Station", "state": "TX", "street": "P.O.
