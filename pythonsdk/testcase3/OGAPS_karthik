Dr. Fowler also had this to say about mentoring: The importance of mentoring and networking during graduate school is very important in the life of a graduate student. Engaging in mentoring relationships benefits both faculty and students. For students those benefits include but are not limited to career advancement, job satisfaction, receiving guidance on ways to navigate the academic pipeline, feeling competent, learns to trust and gains a friend and/or colleague. As for faculty, the benefits include but are not limited to satisfaction for inspiring the students, gains support, and gains a friend and/or colleague.
